Think of it as keeping a detailed diary of all the money coming in and going out of a business. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) defines accounting as 'the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the results thereof.'"

Just as Twi or English helps people communicate ideas, accounting helps businesses communicate their financial health. When you see a company's financial statements, you're reading their 'story' told through numbers."

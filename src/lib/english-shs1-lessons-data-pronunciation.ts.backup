  introduction: `Clear pronunciation is the foundation of effective communication. Pronunciation is more than just producing individual sounds – it includes understanding word stress (which syllables are emphasized) and intonation (how your voice rises and falls). Together, these three elements help you communicate with clarity, confidence, and natural fluency.

**Why Pronunciation Matters:**
- 🎯 **Intelligibility**: Correct pronunciation ensures listeners understand you clearly
- 🎯 **Confidence**: Speaking clearly builds self-assurance in academic and professional settings
- 🎯 **Professional Success**: Good pronunciation is crucial in interviews and workplace communication
- 🎯 **Language Connection**: Pronunciation links sound to meaning, improving your listening comprehension
- 🎯 **Exam Success**: Pronunciation is directly assessed in {{exam:secondary}} Oral English examinations

This lesson covers three interconnected elements: **Individual sounds (pronunciation)**, **which syllables to stress (word stress)**, and **how your voice rises and falls (intonation)**.`,

    {
      title: '1. Understanding English Phonetics and Sound Production',
      content: `English has 44 sounds (phonemes) made from 26 letters – which is why pronunciation can be tricky!

**PHONETIC SYMBOLS:**
English sounds are written in square brackets using IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet):
- /ɪ/ = the vowel sound in "sit"
- /iː/ = the vowel sound in "see"
- /θ/ = the consonant sound in "think"
- /ð/ = the consonant sound in "this"

**VOWEL SOUNDS (14 in English):**
- Pure vowels: /iː/, /ɪ/, /e/, /æ/, /ɑː/, /ɒ/, /ɔː/, /ʊ/, /uː/, /ʌ/, /ə/, /ɜː/
- Diphthongs (2 vowel sounds combined): /eɪ/, /aɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /aʊ/, /əʊ/

**CONSONANT SOUNDS (24 in English):**
- Stop consonants: /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/
- Fricatives: /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /h/
- Affricates: /tʃ/, /dʒ/
- Nasals: /m/, /n/, /ŋ/
- Liquids: /l/, /r/
- Approximants: /j/, /w/`

    {
      title: '2. Word Stress Patterns and Their Impact',
      content: `In English, **one syllable in each word receives primary stress** (spoken louder, longer, and higher in pitch).

**STRESS CHANGES MEANING:**
- **PREsent** (noun) = a gift | **preSENT** (verb) = to give or show
- **REcord** (noun) = a file | **reCORD** (verb) = to tape something
- **CONtent** (adjective) = happy | **conTENT** (noun) = what's inside`
    },
    {
      title: '3. Sentence Stress and Intonation Patterns',
      content: `Beyond individual words, **sentence stress** adds meaning to whole sentences.

**INTONATION PATTERNS:**
- Statements (Falling): "The meeting is tomorrow." ↓
- Questions - Yes/No (Rising): "The meeting is tomorrow?" ↑
- Lists: "I like apples↑, oranges↑, and bananas↓"`
    },
    {
      title: '4. Pronunciation Challenges for Non-Native Learners',
      content: `Many English sounds feel unfamiliar to non-native speakers.

**THE "TH" SOUNDS (/θ/ and /ð/):**
- Problem: Most languages don't have these sounds
- Common mistakes: Replacing with /t/ (think → tink) or /s/ (this → dis)

**THE "R" SOUND (/r/):**
- Problem: Tongue position differs from many languages
- Examples: red, really, very, surprised

**FINAL CONSONANT CLUSTERS:**
- Problem: Many languages don't use multiple consonants at word end
- Examples: ask /æsk/, best /best/, think /θɪŋk/`
    },
    {
      title: '5. Pronunciation Improvement Techniques and Practice',
      content: `Pronunciation improves through active, focused practice using proven techniques.

**THE LISTEN-REPEAT-RECORD CYCLE:**

1. **LISTEN:** Hear the sound/word multiple times
2. **REPEAT:** Say it aloud (not silently in your head)
3. **RECORD AND COMPARE:** Compare your pronunciation to native speaker

**SHADOWING (Speaking While Listening):**
- Play an audio or video of a native speaker
- Follow along, trying to match their pronunciation, stress, intonation
- Especially effective with TED Talks, movies, podcasts`

  summary: `**Lesson Summary: Pronunciation, Stress, and Intonation**

Pronunciation, stress, and intonation are three interconnected elements that work together to make your English clear, natural, and engaging.

**Remember:** Your accent is part of your identity. Focus on **clarity and comprehension**, not sounding "native." Native English speakers appreciate your effort and will understand you!`,

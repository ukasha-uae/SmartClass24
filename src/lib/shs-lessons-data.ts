    introduction: `Numbers are fundamental to mathematics and everyday life. From counting items at the market to measuring distances and managing money, we use different types of numbers for different purposes. In Ghana, understanding number systems is essential for commerce, science, engineering, and technology.

The study of number types helps us organize and classify numbers based on their properties and uses. Just as we classify living things into groups (mammals, birds, reptiles), we classify numbers into sets that share common characteristics.

In this lesson, you will learn about the main types of numbers: natural numbers (counting numbers), whole numbers, integers (positive and negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions and decimals), irrational numbers (like π and √2), and real numbers. This knowledge is foundational for algebra, calculus, and advanced mathematics, and it is essential for your WASSCE examinations.

Understanding number types will help you:
• Choose appropriate numbers for calculations
• Understand why some operations work and others don't
• Solve mathematical problems correctly
• Apply mathematics to real-world situations
• Build a strong foundation for higher mathematics`,

        title: '1. Natural Numbers (Counting Numbers)',
        content: `Natural numbers are the numbers we use for counting. They are the most basic type of number that children learn first.

**Definition:** Natural numbers are positive whole numbers starting from 1.

**Set Notation:** ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...}

**Properties:**
• Start from 1 and go to infinity (∞)
• No negative numbers
• No fractions or decimals
• No zero (in traditional definition)
• Used for counting discrete objects

**Real-World Examples in Ghana:**
• Counting oranges at the market: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 oranges
• Number of students in a class: 40 students
• Number of cedi notes: 5 notes of GH₵20
• Number of days in a week: 7 days
• Counting tro-tro passengers

**Why Called "Natural":**
These numbers occur naturally when counting physical objects. You cannot have -2 oranges or 3.5 people!

**Important Note:** Some mathematicians include 0 in natural numbers, calling the set ℕ₀ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. However, the traditional definition excludes zero.`

      {
        title: '2. Whole Numbers',
        content: `Whole numbers are natural numbers plus zero.

**Definition:** Whole numbers include all natural numbers and zero.

**Set Notation:** 𝕎 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...}

**Properties:**
• Includes zero (0)
• All positive counting numbers
• No negative numbers
• No fractions or decimals
• Cannot be broken into parts

**Difference from Natural Numbers:**
• Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
• Whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
• The ONLY difference is the inclusion of ZERO

**Real-World Examples:**
• Temperature cannot go below absolute zero (0 Kelvin)
• Bank account with zero balance: GH₵0.00
• Number of goals scored in a match: 0, 1, 2, 3 goals
• Empty basket has 0 mangoes
• Starting point on a number line

**Why Include Zero?**
Zero is essential in mathematics:
• Represents "nothing" or "absence"
• Placeholder in our decimal system (e.g., 101, 1001)
• Origin point for measurements
• Essential for algebra and calculus

**Visual Representation:**

<--- Natural Numbers --->
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ...

<--- Whole Numbers --->
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ...
\`\`\`

The whole numbers include everything in natural numbers PLUS zero.`

        title: '3. Integers',
        content: `Integers include whole numbers and their negative counterparts.

**Definition:** Integers are all positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers, and zero.

**Set Notation:** ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

**Components:**
• **Negative integers:** -1, -2, -3, -4, ...
• **Zero:** 0
• **Positive integers:** 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (same as natural numbers)

**Properties:**
• Extend infinitely in both directions (positive and negative)
• Include zero
• No fractions or decimals
• Can be positive, negative, or zero
• Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication

**Real-World Examples in Ghana:**
1. **Temperature:**
   • 30°C (positive integer - hot day)
   • 0°C (freezing point of water)
   • -5°C (not common in Ghana, but possible in mountains)

2. **Altitude/Depth:**
   • Mount Afadja: +885 meters (above sea level)
   • Sea level: 0 meters
   • Ocean floor: -200 meters (below sea level)

3. **Finance:**
   • Profit: +GH₵500 (positive)
   • Break-even: GH₵0
   • Loss/Debt: -GH₵300 (negative)

4. **Directions:**
   • 5 steps forward: +5
   • Starting point: 0
   • 3 steps backward: -3

5. **Time:**
   • 2 hours after noon: +2 (2:00 PM)
   • Noon: 0
   • 2 hours before noon: -2 (10:00 AM)

**Number Line Representation:**
\`\`\`
Negative ← Zero → Positive
... -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5 ...
\`\`\`

**Important Rules:**
• Adding a negative is the same as subtracting: 5 + (-3) = 5 - 3 = 2
• Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: 5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8
• Two negatives make a positive when multiplying: (-2) × (-3) = 6`

        title: '4. Rational Numbers',
        content: `Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

**Definition:** A rational number is any number that can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

**Set Notation:** ℚ = {p/q | p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0}

**Forms of Rational Numbers:**
1. **Proper Fractions:** Numerator < Denominator
   • Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 5/8

2. **Improper Fractions:** Numerator ≥ Denominator
   • Examples: 5/3, 7/2, 9/4

3. **Mixed Numbers:** Whole number + fraction
   • Examples: 2¹/₂, 3³/₄, 5²/₃

4. **Terminating Decimals:** End after a finite number of digits
   • Examples: 0.5, 0.75, 2.25, 3.125

5. **Recurring Decimals:** Repeat forever in a pattern
   • Examples: 0.333... (0.3̄), 0.666... (0.6̄), 0.142857142857... (0.1̄42857̄)

6. **Integers:** Can be written as fraction with denominator 1
   • Examples: 5 = 5/1, -3 = -3/1, 0 = 0/1

**Real-World Examples in Ghana:**
1. **Market Measurements:**
   • ¹/₂ kilogram of rice
   • ²/₃ meter of fabric
   • 1³/₄ bunches of plantain

2. **Money:**
   • GH₵2.50 = 5/2 cedis = 2¹/₂ cedis
   • 50 pesewas = 0.50 cedis = ¹/₂ cedi

3. **Cooking:**
   • 1¹/₂ cups of flour
   • ³/₄ spoon of salt
   • 2.5 liters of water

4. **Time:**
   • 1.5 hours = 1³/₀ hours = 90 minutes
   • 0.25 hours = ¹/₄ hour = 15 minutes

5. **Percentages:**
   • 50% = 0.5 = ¹/₂
   • 75% = 0.75 = ³/₄
   • 33.3% = 0.333... = ¹/₃

**Key Properties:**
• **Dense:** Between any two rational numbers, there's always another rational number
• **Closed under +, −, ×, ÷:** Result is always rational (except division by zero)
• Can be positive, negative, or zero
• Can be converted between fraction and decimal form

**Converting Fractions to Decimals:**
Divide numerator by denominator:
• 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5 (terminating)
• 1/3 = 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333... (recurring)
• 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75 (terminating)

**Converting Decimals to Fractions:**
• 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
• 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4
• 0.333... = 1/3`

      {
        title: '5. Irrational Numbers',
        content: `Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.

**Definition:** An irrational number cannot be written as p/q where p and q are integers.

**Characteristics:**
• **Non-terminating:** Decimal never ends
• **Non-repeating:** No pattern repeats
• Cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers
• Infinite non-repeating decimal expansion

**Common Irrational Numbers:**

1. **π (Pi):**
   • π ≈ 3.14159265358979323846...
   • Ratio of circle's circumference to diameter
   • Used in circle calculations
   • Example: Circumference = 2πr

2. **√2 (Square Root of 2):**
   • √2 ≈ 1.41421356237309504880...
   • Length of diagonal of a square with side 1
   • Cannot be simplified to a fraction

3. **√3, √5, √7, √11, √13...:**
   • Square roots of non-perfect squares
   • All are irrational
   • √3 ≈ 1.732050808...
   • √5 ≈ 2.236067977...

4. **e (Euler's Number):**
   • e ≈ 2.71828182845904523536...
   • Important in calculus and growth calculations
   • Base of natural logarithm

5. **φ (Golden Ratio):**
   • φ ≈ 1.61803398874989484820...
   • Found in nature, art, and architecture
   • Ratio in Fibonacci sequence

**Real-World Applications in Ghana:**

1. **Construction:**
   • Calculating diagonal bracing in buildings
   • Circular structures (π for circumference and area)
   • Example: Building a circular well, you need π to calculate materials

2. **Land Surveying:**
   • Calculating distances involving right triangles
   • Using Pythagoras' theorem: c = √(a² + b²)

3. **Engineering:**
   • Designing circular roads, roundabouts
   • Calculating volumes of cylindrical water tanks

**Why Are They Important?**
• Represent exact values (π is more accurate than 3.14 or 22/7)
• Essential in geometry, trigonometry, calculus
• Occur naturally in mathematics and physics
• Required for precise scientific calculations

**Common Misconception:**
• 22/7 is NOT equal to π (it's a rational approximation)
• 22/7 ≈ 3.142857142857... (repeating)
• π ≈ 3.141592653589793... (non-repeating)
• Difference seems small but matters in precision work

**Proof that √2 is Irrational:**
This is a famous proof by contradiction. Assume √2 = p/q (in lowest terms). Then:
• 2 = p²/q²
• 2q² = p²
• This means p² is even, so p is even
• Let p = 2k
• Then 2q² = (2k)² = 4k²
• So q² = 2k²
• This means q is also even
• But if both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2
• This contradicts our assumption that p/q is in lowest terms
• Therefore, √2 cannot be written as a fraction
• Hence, √2 is irrational`

    summary: 'In this lesson, you learned about the classification of numbers into different sets: natural numbers (1, 2, 3...), whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...), integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...), rational numbers (fractions and terminating/recurring decimals), irrational numbers (non-terminating, non-repeating decimals like π and √2), and real numbers (all rational and irrational numbers). Understanding these number types is foundational for algebra and higher mathematics. Remember: Every natural number is whole, every whole number is an integer, every integer is rational, and every rational and irrational number is real. This hierarchy helps you classify and work with numbers correctly in mathematical problems and real-world applications.'

    introduction: `Fractions, decimals, and percentages are three different ways of expressing the same concept: parts of a whole. In Ghana, we use these daily - from calculating market prices and discounts to measuring ingredients in cooking, sharing resources, and understanding financial transactions.

Understanding the relationship between these three forms is essential for:
• **Commerce:** Calculating discounts (20% off), profit margins, VAT (15%)
• **Cooking:** Following recipes (1½ cups, 0.5 liters)
• **Finance:** Understanding interest rates, savings, loans
• **Measurements:** Converting between units (0.5 meters = ½ meter = 50%)
• **WASSCE Exam:** Many questions test conversion and calculation skills

This lesson will teach you how to seamlessly convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages, and how to perform calculations with each. You'll learn practical techniques that will help you in everyday life and excel in your examinations.`,

    keyConcepts: [
      {
        title: '1. Understanding Fractions',
        content: `A fraction represents a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator (top number) and denominator (bottom number).

**Fraction Notation:** a/b where:
• a = numerator (number of parts we have)
• b = denominator (total number of equal parts)

**Types of Fractions:**

1. **Proper Fraction:** Numerator < Denominator
   • Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 5/8, 7/10
   • Value is less than 1
   • Ghana example: 3/4 of a loaf of bread

2. **Improper Fraction:** Numerator ≥ Denominator
   • Examples: 5/3, 7/4, 9/2, 11/5
   • Value is greater than or equal to 1
   • Can be converted to mixed numbers

3. **Mixed Number:** Whole number + proper fraction
   • Examples: 1½, 2¾, 3⅖
   • Represents more than one whole
   • Ghana example: 2½ bunches of plantain

**Converting Between Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers:**

Improper → Mixed:
• 7/3 = 7 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 1 = 2⅓

Mixed → Improper:
• 2⅓ = (2 × 3 + 1)/3 = 7/3

**Equivalent Fractions:**
Fractions that represent the same value:
• 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = 5/10
• Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by the same number

**Simplifying Fractions:**
Reduce to lowest terms by dividing by the GCF (Greatest Common Factor):
• 12/16 = (12÷4)/(16÷4) = 3/4
• 15/25 = (15÷5)/(25÷5) = 3/5

**Real-World Ghana Examples:**
• Market: "Give me 3/4 kg of tomatoes"
• Money: "I have 2/5 of the money I need"
• Time: "The journey took 1½ hours"
• Sharing: "Divide 5 oranges among 3 children = 5/3 = 1⅔ oranges each"`
      },
      {
        title: '2. Operations with Fractions',
        content: `**Addition and Subtraction:**

Same Denominator:
• Add/subtract numerators, keep denominator
• 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7
• 5/9 - 2/9 = 3/9 = 1/3

Different Denominators:
1. Find LCD (Lowest Common Denominator)
2. Convert to equivalent fractions
3. Add/subtract numerators

Example: 1/2 + 1/3
• LCD = 6
• 1/2 = 3/6, 1/3 = 2/6
• 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6

**Multiplication:**
• Multiply numerators together
• Multiply denominators together
• Simplify if possible

Examples:
• 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2
• 1/2 × 4/5 = 4/10 = 2/5

Shortcut (Cancel before multiplying):
• 2/3 × 3/8 = (2×3)/(3×8) = 2/8 = 1/4
• Can cancel the 3s first: 2/3 × 3/8 = 2/8 = 1/4

**Division:**
• Keep first fraction
• Change ÷ to ×
• Flip second fraction (reciprocal)
• Multiply

Rule: a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c

Examples:
• 2/3 ÷ 1/2 = 2/3 × 2/1 = 4/3 = 1⅓
• 3/4 ÷ 2/5 = 3/4 × 5/2 = 15/8 = 1⅞

**Mixed Number Operations:**
Convert to improper fractions first:
• 2½ + 1¾ = 5/2 + 7/4 = 10/4 + 7/4 = 17/4 = 4¼

**Ghana Market Example:**
"If 1 bunch of plantain costs GH₵15, what is the cost of 2¾ bunches?"
• Cost = 15 × 2¾ = 15 × 11/4 = 165/4 = 41.25
• Answer: GH₵41.25`
      },
      {
        title: '3. Understanding Decimals',
        content: `Decimals are another way to represent fractions, especially tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.

**Decimal Place Value:**
\`\`\`
Example: 45.678
  4 = Tens
  5 = Ones (Units)
  . = Decimal Point
  6 = Tenths (1/10)
  7 = Hundredths (1/100)
  8 = Thousandths (1/1000)
\`\`\`

**Types of Decimals:**

1. **Terminating Decimals:** End after finite digits
   • 0.5, 0.75, 2.25, 3.125
   • All can be written as fractions

2. **Recurring Decimals:** Repeat forever
   • 0.333... = 0.3̄ (repeating 3)
   • 0.666... = 0.6̄ (repeating 6)
   • 0.142857142857... = 0.1̄42857̄

**Reading Decimals:**
• 0.5 = "zero point five" or "five tenths"
• 2.75 = "two point seven five" or "two and seventy-five hundredths"
• 0.125 = "zero point one two five" or "one hundred twenty-five thousandths"

**Decimal Operations:**

Addition/Subtraction:
• Align decimal points vertically
• Add/subtract as normal

Example:
\`\`\`
  12.50
+  3.75
-------
  16.25
\`\`\`

Multiplication:
• Multiply as whole numbers
• Count total decimal places
• Place decimal point in answer

Example: 2.5 × 3.2
\`\`\`
25 × 32 = 800
1 + 1 = 2 decimal places
Answer: 8.00 = 8.0
\`\`\`

Division:
• Move decimal point in divisor to make it whole
• Move decimal point in dividend same number of places
• Divide normally

Example: 12.5 ÷ 2.5
\`\`\`
125 ÷ 25 = 5
\`\`\`

**Ghana Currency Example:**
• GH₵50.75 = 50 cedis and 75 pesewas
• GH₵50.75 + GH₵23.50 = GH₵74.25
• GH₵100.00 - GH₵45.25 = GH₵54.75`

      {
        title: '4. Converting Between Fractions and Decimals',
        content: `**Fraction → Decimal:**
Divide numerator by denominator

Examples:
• 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
• 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75
• 1/3 = 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333... = 0.3̄
• 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4
• 7/8 = 7 ÷ 8 = 0.875

**Decimal → Fraction:**

Method 1: Use place value
• 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
• 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4
• 0.125 = 125/1000 = 1/8

Method 2: Count decimal places
• 1 decimal place → denominator 10
• 2 decimal places → denominator 100
• 3 decimal places → denominator 1000

Examples:
• 0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5
• 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
• 0.375 = 375/1000 = 3/8

**Recurring Decimals → Fractions:**

For 0.3̄ (0.333...):
Let x = 0.333...
10x = 3.333...
10x - x = 3.333... - 0.333...
9x = 3
x = 3/9 = 1/3

For 0.1̄6̄ (0.166666...):
Let x = 0.1666...
100x = 16.666...
10x = 1.666...
100x - 10x = 15
90x = 15
x = 15/90 = 1/6

**Common Conversions to Memorize:**
• 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
• 1/3 = 0.3̄ = 33.3%
• 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
• 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%
• 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%
• 1/10 = 0.1 = 10%
• 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%
• 2/3 = 0.6̄ = 66.7%`
      },
      {
        title: '5. Understanding Percentages',
        content: `Percentage means "per hundred" or "out of 100". The symbol % represents /100.

**Basic Concept:**
• 50% = 50/100 = 0.5 = 1/2
• 75% = 75/100 = 0.75 = 3/4
• 100% = 100/100 = 1 (the whole)
• 200% = 200/100 = 2 (twice the whole)

**Percentage → Fraction:**
Write over 100 and simplify
• 25% = 25/100 = 1/4
• 60% = 60/100 = 3/5
• 80% = 80/100 = 4/5

**Percentage → Decimal:**
Divide by 100 (move decimal point 2 places left)
• 35% = 35 ÷ 100 = 0.35
• 7% = 7 ÷ 100 = 0.07
• 125% = 125 ÷ 100 = 1.25

**Fraction → Percentage:**
Multiply by 100
• 1/2 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%
• 3/4 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%
• 2/5 = 0.4 × 100 = 40%

**Decimal → Percentage:**
Multiply by 100 (move decimal point 2 places right)
• 0.45 = 45%
• 0.08 = 8%
• 1.5 = 150%

**Finding a Percentage of a Number:**

Method 1: Convert to decimal and multiply
• Find 20% of 500
• 20% = 0.2
• 0.2 × 500 = 100

Method 2: Use fraction
• Find 25% of 80
• 25% = 1/4
• 1/4 × 80 = 20

Method 3: Find 1% first, then multiply
• Find 15% of 200
• 1% of 200 = 2
• 15% = 15 × 2 = 30

**Ghana Examples:**
1. **VAT:** 15% of GH₵100 = 0.15 × 100 = GH₵15
2. **Discount:** 20% off GH₵50 = 0.2 × 50 = GH₵10 off → Pay GH₵40
3. **Test Score:** 45 out of 50 = 45/50 = 0.9 = 90%
4. **Interest:** 12% interest on GH₵1000 = 0.12 × 1000 = GH₵120`
      },
      {
        title: '6. Percentage Increase and Decrease',
        content: `**Percentage Increase:**

Formula: New Value = Original Value × (1 + Percentage/100)

Or: Increase = Original × (Percentage/100)
    New Value = Original + Increase

Example: A shirt costing GH₵80 increases by 25%. Find new price.
• Method 1: 80 × 1.25 = GH₵100
• Method 2: Increase = 80 × 0.25 = 20; New = 80 + 20 = GH₵100

**Percentage Decrease:**

Formula: New Value = Original Value × (1 - Percentage/100)

Example: A phone costing GH₵1200 has 15% discount. Find sale price.
• 1200 × 0.85 = GH₵1020
• Or: Discount = 1200 × 0.15 = 180; New = 1200 - 180 = 1020

**Finding Percentage Change:**

Formula: Percentage Change = (Difference/Original) × 100

Increase Example:
• Price rose from GH₵200 to GH₵250
• Change = 250 - 200 = 50
• Percentage = (50/200) × 100 = 25% increase

Decrease Example:
• Price fell from GH₵300 to GH₵240
• Change = 300 - 240 = 60
• Percentage = (60/300) × 100 = 20% decrease

**Ghana Market Examples:**

1. **Inflation:**
   • Last year: Bag of rice = GH₵200
   • This year: Bag of rice = GH₵230
   • Increase = 30; Percentage = (30/200) × 100 = 15%

2. **Sale:**
   • Original: GH₵150
   • 30% off: 150 × 0.70 = GH₵105

3. **Profit:**
   • Cost: GH₵500
   • Selling price: GH₵650
   • Profit = 150; Percentage = (150/500) × 100 = 30%

**Multiple Percentage Changes:**
A 20% increase followed by 20% decrease ≠ original value!

Example: Start with GH₵100
• After 20% increase: 100 × 1.2 = GH₵120
• After 20% decrease: 120 × 0.8 = GH₵96
• Final value is less than original!`

3. **Finding 1%:** Divide by 100
   • 1% of 3000 = 30

4. **Finding 50%:** Divide by 2
   • 50% of 86 = 43

5. **Finding 25%:** Divide by 4
   • 25% of 120 = 30

6. **Finding 75%:** Find 25% and multiply by 3
   • 75% of 80 = 25% (20) × 3 = 60

**WASSCE Exam Tips:**
• Always simplify fractions to lowest terms
• Show working for conversions

    introduction: `Sets are collections of distinct objects or elements. Set theory is fundamental to mathematics and has practical applications in everyday life, from organizing data to solving logical problems.

In Ghana, we use set concepts daily:
• **Schools:** Grouping students (set of JHS students, set of SHS students)
• **Markets:** Categories of goods (set of fruits, set of vegetables)
• **Technology:** Database organization, search filters
• **Statistics:** Organizing and analyzing data
• **Planning:** Event attendance, voter registration

Understanding sets helps you:
• Organize information logically
• Solve complex counting and probability problems
• Analyze relationships between groups
• Prepare for WASSCE questions on sets (very common!)

Venn diagrams provide a visual way to represent sets and their relationships. Named after British mathematician John Venn, these diagrams use circles to show how sets overlap and interact. This lesson will teach you set notation, operations, and how to use Venn diagrams to solve problems efficiently.`,

    keyConcepts: [
      {
        title: '1. What is a Set? Basic Terminology',
        content: `**Definition:** A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects called elements or members.

**Well-defined** means we can clearly determine whether an object belongs to the set or not.

**Set Notation:**
• Sets are usually denoted by capital letters: A, B, C, X, Y, Z
• Elements are listed in braces { }
• Elements are denoted by lowercase letters: a, b, c, x, y, z

Examples:
• A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
• B = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday}
• C = {Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, Tamale}

**Membership:**
• ∈ means "is an element of" or "belongs to"
• ∉ means "is not an element of"

Examples:
• 3 ∈ A (3 is an element of set A)
• 6 ∉ A (6 is not an element of set A)
• Accra ∈ C (Accra is in set C)
• Lagos ∉ C (Lagos is not in set C)

**Ways to Describe Sets:**

1. **Listing Method (Roster Method):**
   List all elements between braces
   • A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   • B = {a, e, i, o, u}

2. **Set-Builder Notation:**
   Describe the rule for membership
   • A = {x | x is a natural number less than 6}
   • B = {x | x is a vowel in the English alphabet}
   • Read as: "the set of all x such that..."

3. **Word Description:**
   Describe in words
   • A is the set of natural numbers from 1 to 5
   • B is the set of vowels

**Ghana Examples:**
• G = {Greater Accra, Ashanti, Central, Western, Eastern, Volta, ...} (Regions of Ghana)
• F = {GH₵1, GH₵2, GH₵5, GH₵10, GH₵20, GH₵50, GH₵100, GH₵200} (Ghanaian banknotes)
• S = {English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies} (Core subjects)

**Cardinality:**
The number of elements in a set, denoted by n(A) or |A|
• If A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then n(A) = 5
• If B = {a, e, i, o, u}, then n(B) = 5`
      },
      {
        title: '2. Types of Sets',
        content: `**1. Finite Set:**
Has a countable number of elements

Examples:
• A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → n(A) = 5
• B = {days of the week} → n(B) = 7
• C = {months in a year} → n(C) = 12

**2. Infinite Set:**
Has unlimited (uncountable) elements

Examples:
• ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} (natural numbers)
• ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} (integers)
• Even numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}

Notation: Use ... (ellipsis) to show pattern continues

**3. Empty Set (Null Set):**
Contains no elements
Symbols: ∅ or { }

Examples:
• Set of months with 32 days = ∅
• {x | x is a student who is 200 years old} = ∅
• {x | x² = -1, x is real} = ∅

Important: n(∅) = 0

**4. Singleton Set:**
Contains exactly one element

Examples:
• {0}
• {Accra} (if only considering capital cities of Ghana)
• {x | x + 5 = 8} = {3}

**5. Equal Sets:**
Have exactly the same elements
A = B if every element of A is in B and vice versa

Examples:
• {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} (order doesn't matter)
• {a, b, c} = {a, a, b, c} (repetition doesn't matter)

**6. Equivalent Sets:**
Have the same number of elements (same cardinality)
Sets don't need to be equal, just same size

Examples:
• A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b, c}
• n(A) = n(B) = 3, so A ~ B (equivalent)

**7. Universal Set:**
Contains all elements under consideration
Denoted by U or ξ (xi)

Example:
If discussing students:
• U = {all students in school}
• A = {Form 1 students}
• B = {Form 2 students}

**8. Subset:**
A is a subset of B (A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also in B

Examples:
• {1, 2} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4}
• {vowels} ⊆ {letters of alphabet}

Properties:
• Every set is a subset of itself: A ⊆ A
• Empty set is subset of every set: ∅ ⊆ A
• If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then A = B

**Proper Subset:**
A ⊂ B means A is subset of B but A ≠ B

Example:
• {1, 2} ⊂ {1, 2, 3} (proper subset)
• {1, 2, 3} ⊆ {1, 2, 3} (subset but not proper)`

        title: '3. Set Operations - Union',
        content: `**Union (∪):**
The union of sets A and B is the set of all elements in A or B or both.

**Symbol:** A ∪ B

**Definition:** A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

**Examples:**

1. A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
   A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   (3 appears in both, but listed once)

2. A = {a, b, c}, B = {c, d, e}
   A ∪ B = {a, b, c, d, e}

3. A = {students who play football}, B = {students who play basketball}
   A ∪ B = {students who play football or basketball or both}

  "labels": { "A": "A", "B": "B", "U": "U" },
  "shade": ["A", "B", "AB"]

Shaded region = A ∪ B

**Properties of Union:**
1. Commutative: A ∪ B = B ∪ A
2. Associative: (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
3. Identity: A ∪ ∅ = A
4. Idempotent: A ∪ A = A
5. Universal: A ∪ U = U

**Cardinality Formula:**
n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B)

Example:
• n(A) = 20, n(B) = 15, n(A ∩ B) = 5
• n(A ∪ B) = 20 + 15 - 5 = 30

**Ghana Example:**
• A = {students who study French} → n(A) = 25
• B = {students who study Spanish} → n(B) = 30
• Both languages: n(A ∩ B) = 10
• Total studying at least one language = 25 + 30 - 10 = 45`

        title: '4. Set Operations - Intersection',
        content: `**Intersection (∩):**
The intersection of sets A and B is the set of elements common to both A and B.

**Symbol:** A ∩ B

**Definition:** A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

**Examples:**

1. A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
   A ∩ B = {3, 4}

2. A = {a, b, c}, B = {d, e, f}
   A ∩ B = ∅ (no common elements)

**Properties of Intersection:**
1. Commutative: A ∩ B = B ∩ A

3. Identity: A ∩ U = A
4. Idempotent: A ∩ A = A
5. Universal: A ∩ ∅ = ∅

**Disjoint Sets:**
Sets with no common elements
If A ∩ B = ∅, then A and B are disjoint

Example:
• A = {odd numbers}
• B = {even numbers}
• A ∩ B = ∅ (disjoint)

**Ghana Example:**
A = {students who scored A in Math} = 40 students
B = {students who scored A in Science} = 35 students
A ∩ B = {students who scored A in both} = 15 students

This means:
• Only Math A: 40 - 15 = 25
• Only Science A: 35 - 15 = 20
• Both subjects A: 15
• At least one A: 25 + 20 + 15 = 60

**Distributive Laws:**
1. A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
2. A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)`

        title: '5. Set Operations - Complement and Difference',
        content: `**Complement (A'):**
The complement of set A is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are NOT in A.

**Symbols:** A', A^c, or Ā

**Definition:** A' = {x | x ∈ U and x ∉ A}

**Example:**
• U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
• A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} (even numbers)

**Properties of Complement:**
1. (A')' = A (complement of complement is original)
2. A ∪ A' = U (union with complement is universal set)
3. A ∩ A' = ∅ (intersection with complement is empty)
4. U' = ∅ (complement of universal set is empty)
5. ∅' = U (complement of empty set is universal)

**De Morgan's Laws:**
1. (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
2. (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'

**Set Difference (A - B):**
Elements in A but NOT in B

**Symbol:** A - B or A \\ B

**Definition:** A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

**Examples:**

1. A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {4, 5, 6, 7}
   A - B = {1, 2, 3}

2. A = {a, b, c, d}, B = {b, d}
   A - B = {a, c}

**Important:** A - B ≠ B - A (not commutative)

Example:
• A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
• A - B = {1, 2}
• B - A = {5, 6}

**Relationship:**
A - B = A ∩ B'

**Ghana School Example:**
U = {all students} = 500
A = {students who passed Math} = 380
A' = {students who failed Math} = 500 - 380 = 120

If:
B = {students who passed English} = 400
A - B = {passed Math but failed English}
B - A = {passed English but failed Math}
A ∩ B = {passed both subjects}`

**Four Regions:**
1. Only A: A - B
2. Only B: B - A
3. Both A and B: A ∩ B
4. Neither A nor B: (A ∪ B)'

**Worked Example:**
In a class of 40 students:
• 25 study French (F)
• 20 study Spanish (S)
• 8 study both languages
• How many study neither?

**Step 1: Draw Venn diagram**

  "values": { "A": "?", "B": "?", "AB": "8", "U": "?" }

**Step 2: Fill in known values**
• Both (F ∩ S) = 8

**Step 3: Calculate "only" regions**
• Only F = 25 - 8 = 17
• Only S = 20 - 8 = 12

**Step 4: Calculate total in circles**
• In F or S = 17 + 8 + 12 = 37

**Step 5: Calculate neither**
• Neither = 40 - 37 = 3

**Answer:**
• Only French: 17 students
• Only Spanish: 12 students
• Both: 8 students
• Neither: 3 students

**Verification:**
17 + 12 + 8 + 3 = 40 ✓

5. A ∩ C only (not B)
6. B ∩ C only (not A)

• 30 play volleyball (V)
• 20 play both F and B
• 15 play both F and V
• 10 play both B and V
• 5 play all three sports
• How many play none?

**Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Start with center (all three)**
A ∩ B ∩ C = 5

**Step 2: Calculate "only two" regions**
• F ∩ B only = 20 - 5 = 15
• F ∩ V only = 15 - 5 = 10
• B ∩ V only = 10 - 5 = 5

**Step 3: Calculate "only one" regions**
• Only F = 60 - (15 + 5 + 10) = 30
• Only B = 50 - (15 + 5 + 5) = 25
• Only V = 30 - (10 + 5 + 5) = 10

**Step 4: Calculate total in circles**
Total = 30 + 25 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 100

**Step 5: Calculate none**
None = 100 - 100 = 0

**Answer:** 0 students play none (all play at least one sport)

**Cardinality Formula (3 sets):**
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) 
              • n(A ∩ B) - n(A ∩ C) - n(B ∩ C)

**Problem:**
In a class of 50 students, 30 offer Economics and 25 offer Geography. If 10 students offer both subjects, find the number of students who offer:
i) Economics only
ii) Geography only
iii) Neither subject

**Step 1: Define Your Sets**
First, write down what you know using set notation.
• $n(U) = 50$ (Total students)
• $n(E) = 30$ (Economics)
• $n(G) = 25$ (Geography)
• $n(E \\cap G) = 10$ (Both)

**Step 2: Draw the Diagram & Fill the Center**
Draw two overlapping circles. **Always fill the intersection first.**
• Place **10** in the middle where the circles overlap.

**Step 3: Calculate "Only" Regions**
The circle for Economics ($E$) must add up to 30. We already have 10 in it.
• **Economics Only:** $30 - 10 = 20$
  *(Write 20 in the left part of circle E)*

The circle for Geography ($G$) must add up to 25. We already have 10 in it.
• **Geography Only:** $25 - 10 = 15$
  *(Write 15 in the right part of circle G)*

**Step 4: Calculate "Neither"**
Add up everything inside the circles:
• Total in circles = (E only) + (G only) + (Both)
• Total = $20 + 15 + 10 = 45$

The total class size is 50. The remainder are those who offer neither.
• **Neither:** $50 - 45 = 5$
  *(Write 5 outside the circles)*

**Problem:**
In a survey of 60 people:
• 25 read Daily Graphic (G)
• 26 read Ghanaian Times (T)
• 26 read Daily Guide (D)
• 9 read both G and T
• 11 read both G and D
• 8 read both T and D
• 8 read all three newspapers.
Find the number of people who read **exactly one** newspaper.

**Step 1: The Golden Rule - Start from the Center**
Find the number for "all three" and put it in the very center.
• $n(G \\cap T \\cap D) = 8$

**Step 2: Fill the "Petals" (Intersections of Two)**
The problem says "9 read both G and T". This includes the 8 who read all three.
• **G and T only:** $9 - 8 = 1$
• **G and D only:** $11 - 8 = 3$
• **T and D only:** $8 - 8 = 0$

*Check your diagram: Do the intersections add up to the given numbers? (e.g., $1 + 8 = 9$ for G and T). Yes.*

**Step 3: Fill the "Outer Leaves" (Only One)**
Now, look at the whole circle for Daily Graphic (G). It must total 25.
Subtract the three numbers already inside circle G (the center and two petals).
• **Graphic Only:** $25 - (1 + 3 + 8) = 25 - 12 = 13$

Do the same for Times (T). Total is 26.
• **Times Only:** $26 - (1 + 0 + 8) = 26 - 9 = 17$

Do the same for Guide (D). Total is 26.
• **Guide Only:** $26 - (3 + 0 + 8) = 26 - 11 = 15$

**Step 4: The Final Diagram**

*(Note: We calculated the outside number: $60 - (13+17+15+1+3+0+8) = 60 - 57 = 3$)*

The question asks for "exactly one newspaper".
Add the "Only" regions:
• Answer = (Graphic Only) + (Times Only) + (Guide Only)
• Answer = $13 + 17 + 15 = 45$ people.`

    summary: 'Sets are well-defined collections of distinct objects. In this lesson, you learned set notation (∈, ∉, ⊆, ⊂), types of sets (finite, infinite, empty, universal), and set operations: union (A ∪ B = elements in A or B), intersection (A ∩ B = elements in both), complement (A\' = elements not in A), and difference (A - B = elements in A but not B). Venn diagrams visually represent sets and their relationships using circles. For two-set problems, use n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B). For three-set problems, always start with the center (all three), then work outward. De Morgan\'s Laws: (A ∪ B)\' = A\' ∩ B\' and (A ∩ B)\' = A\' ∪ B\'. These concepts are fundamental for algebra, probability, and WASSCE success.'

    introduction: `Algebra is the language of mathematics. While arithmetic deals with specific numbers (like 5 + 3 = 8), algebra uses letters to represent unknown values or variables, allowing us to solve general problems and create formulas that work in many situations.

In Ghana, we use algebraic thinking daily without realizing it:
• **Market calculations:** If one orange costs x cedis, then 5 oranges cost 5x cedis
• **Mobile data:** If 1GB costs GH₵5, then n GB costs 5n cedis
• **Construction:** If a room needs 4 bags of cement per square meter, and the area is A m², you need 4A bags
• **Transportation:** If fuel costs c cedis per liter and you buy g liters, total cost is cg cedis

Algebraic expressions are the foundation for solving equations, understanding functions, and tackling complex real-world problems. This lesson will teach you how to read, write, simplify, expand, and factorize algebraic expressions - essential skills for WASSCE success and advanced mathematics.

Understanding algebra opens doors to careers in engineering, computer science, economics, accounting, and any field requiring analytical thinking.`,

    keyConcepts: [
      {
        title: '1. Understanding Algebraic Expressions - Terms and Components',
        content: `An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase that contains numbers, variables (letters), and operations (+, −, ×, ÷).

**Components of Algebraic Expressions:**

1. **Variables (Letters):**
   • Represent unknown or changing values
   • Common variables: x, y, z, a, b, c, n, m
   • Examples: x, 2y, 5a, −3b

2. **Constants (Numbers):**
   • Fixed values that don't change
   • Examples: 5, −3, 7, 0.5, π

3. **Coefficients:**
   • Numbers multiplied by variables
   • In 5x, the coefficient is 5
   • In −3y, the coefficient is −3
   • If no number shown, coefficient is 1: x means 1x

4. **Terms:**
   • Parts of an expression separated by + or − signs
   • Examples:
     • 3x + 5y − 2 has **three terms**: 3x, 5y, and −2
     • 7a − 4b + 9 has **three terms**: 7a, −4b, and 9
     • 2x² + 5x − 3 has **three terms**: 2x², 5x, and −3

5. **Operators:**
   • Symbols showing operations: +, −, ×, ÷
   • Multiplication often implied: 5x means 5 × x
   • Division written as fractions: x/2 means x ÷ 2

**Examples Breakdown:**

**Expression: 4x + 7**
• Terms: 4x and 7
• Variable: x
• Coefficient of x: 4
• Constant: 7

**Expression: 3a − 5b + 2**
• Terms: 3a, −5b, and 2
• Variables: a and b
• Coefficient of a: 3
• Coefficient of b: −5
• Constant: 2

**Expression: 2x² + 5x − 8**
• Terms: 2x², 5x, and −8
• Variable: x
• Coefficient of x²: 2
• Coefficient of x: 5
• Constant: −8

**Ghana Example:**
If bananas cost b cedis per bunch and plantains cost p cedis per bunch:
• Buying 3 bunches of bananas costs: **3b cedis**
• Buying 2 bunches of plantains costs: **2p cedis**
• Total cost: **3b + 2p cedis** (algebraic expression)

**Important Notes:**
• 5x means 5 × x (multiplication sign often omitted)
• x means 1x (coefficient is 1 when not shown)
• −x means −1x (coefficient is −1)
• xy means x × y (both are variables)
• Terms are separated by + or − signs, NOT by × or ÷`
      },
      {
        title: '2. Like Terms vs Unlike Terms',
        content: `Understanding the difference between like and unlike terms is crucial for simplifying expressions.

**Like Terms:**
• Have the **same variable(s)** raised to the **same power**
• Only coefficients can be different
• Can be combined (added or subtracted)

**Examples of Like Terms:**

**Set 1:** 5x, 3x, −2x, 8x
• All have variable x
• All have same power (x¹)
• Can combine: 5x + 3x = 8x

**Set 2:** 4y², 7y², −3y², y²
• All have variable y²
• All have same power (2)
• Can combine: 4y² + 7y² = 11y²

**Set 3:** 2ab, 5ab, −ab, 3ab
• All have variables a and b
• Can combine: 2ab + 5ab = 7ab

**Unlike Terms:**
• Have **different variables** OR **different powers**
• Cannot be combined
• Must remain separate in the expression

**Examples of Unlike Terms:**

**Cannot combine:**
• 3x and 5y (different variables)
• 2x and 4x² (different powers)
• 5a and 3b (different variables)
• xy and x²y (different powers of x)

**Key Recognition Rules:**

1. **Same variable, same power = LIKE**
   • 7m and 3m → LIKE ✓
   • Can combine: 7m + 3m = 10m

2. **Different variables = UNLIKE**
   • 5x and 3y → UNLIKE ✗
   • Cannot combine: 5x + 3y stays as is

3. **Same variable, different powers = UNLIKE**
   • 4x and 2x² → UNLIKE ✗
   • Cannot combine: 4x + 2x² stays as is

4. **Constants are always like terms**
   • 5, 7, −3, 10 → LIKE ✓
   • Can combine: 5 + 7 − 3 = 9

**Practice Identification:**

**Expression: 5x + 3y − 2x + 4y + 7**

Like terms groups:
• 5x and −2x (both have x)
• 3y and 4y (both have y)
• 7 (constant, stands alone)

Result after combining:
• (5x − 2x) + (3y + 4y) + 7
• 3x + 7y + 7

**Ghana Market Example:**
• 3 apples + 5 oranges + 2 apples + 4 oranges
• Group like items: (3 apples + 2 apples) + (5 oranges + 4 oranges)
• Result: 5 apples + 9 oranges
• Algebraically: 3a + 5o + 2a + 4o = 5a + 9o

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
❌ 2x + 3x = 5x² (WRONG - don't change the power)
✓ 2x + 3x = 5x (CORRECT)

❌ 4x + 5y = 9xy (WRONG - can't combine unlike terms)
✓ 4x + 5y = 4x + 5y (CORRECT - leave as is)

❌ x + x + x = x³ (WRONG - don't use exponents)
✓ x + x + x = 3x (CORRECT - count how many x's)`

        title: '3. Simplifying Algebraic Expressions - Combining Like Terms',
        content: `Simplifying means making an expression as short and neat as possible by combining like terms.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1:** Identify all like terms (group by variable and power)
**Step 2:** Add or subtract coefficients of like terms
**Step 3:** Keep unlike terms separate
**Step 4:** Write in standard form (highest power first, then constants)

**Example 1: Simple Simplification**

Simplify: 7x + 3x − 2x

Solution:
• All terms have x (like terms)
• Combine coefficients: 7 + 3 − 2 = 8

Step 1: Group like terms
• a terms: 5a, −2a
• b terms: 3b, 7b

Step 2: Combine each group
• 5a − 2a = 3a
• 3b + 7b = 10b

Answer: **3a + 10b**

**Example 3: With Constants**

Simplify: 4x + 9 − 2x + 5 + 3x

Solution:
Step 1: Group like terms
• x terms: 4x, −2x, 3x
• Constants: 9, 5

Step 2: Combine
• 4x − 2x + 3x = 5x
• 9 + 5 = 14

Answer: **5x + 14**

**Example 4: Different Powers**

Simplify: 3x² + 5x + 2x² − 3x + 7

Solution:
Step 1: Group like terms
• x² terms: 3x², 2x²
• x terms: 5x, −3x
• Constant: 7

Step 2: Combine
• 3x² + 2x² = 5x²
• 5x − 3x = 2x
• 7 stays as is

Answer: **5x² + 2x + 7**

**Example 5: Negative Coefficients**

Simplify: 6y − 4y − 2y + 8y

Solution:
• All have y (like terms)
• Combine: 6 − 4 − 2 + 8 = 8
• Answer: **8y**

**Example 6: Complex Expression**

Simplify: 5m + 3n − 2m + 4p + 7n − p + 6

Solution:
Step 1: Group
• m terms: 5m, −2m
• n terms: 3n, 7n

**Ghana Shopping Example:**

Problem: Kofi buys items at the market
• 5 oranges at x cedis each: 5x
• 3 more oranges: 3x
• 4 apples at y cedis each: 4y
• 2 more apples: 2y
• Transportation: 8 cedis

Total cost expression: 5x + 3x + 4y + 2y + 8

Simplify:
• Orange terms: 5x + 3x = 8x
• Apple terms: 4y + 2y = 6y
• Constant: 8

Simplified: **8x + 6y + 8**

This means: 8 oranges + 6 apples + GH₵8 transport

**Writing Tips:**
1. Write terms in descending order of powers: x³, x², x, constant
2. Don't write 1 in front of variables: write x, not 1x
3. Don't write + before negative: write 5x − 3, not 5x + −3
4. If result is zero, write 0, not nothing`

        title: '4. Expanding Expressions - The Distributive Law',
        content: `Expanding means removing brackets by multiplying everything inside the bracket by what's outside.

**The Distributive Law:**
a(b + c) = ab + ac

This means: multiply a by b, then multiply a by c

**Example 1: Basic Expansion**

Expand: 3(x + 5)

Solution:
• Multiply 3 by everything inside
• 3 × x = 3x
• 3 × 5 = 15
• Answer: **3x + 15**

**Example 2: With Subtraction**

Expand: 5(2x − 3)

Solution:
• 5 × 2x = 10x
• 5 × (−3) = −15
• Answer: **10x − 15**

**Example 3: Negative Outside**

Expand: −2(x + 7)

Solution:
• −2 × x = −2x
• −2 × 7 = −14
• Answer: **−2x − 14**

**Example 4: Variable Outside**

Expand: x(x + 4)

Solution:
• x × x = x²
• x × 4 = 4x
• Answer: **x² + 4x**

**Example 5: Two Terms Outside**

Expand: (x + 3)(x + 5)

Solution (FOIL method):
• **F**irst: x × x = x²
• **O**uter: x × 5 = 5x
• **I**nner: 3 × x = 3x
• **L**ast: 3 × 5 = 15

Combine like terms: x² + 5x + 3x + 15
Answer: **x² + 8x + 15**

**Example 6: Difference of Squares Pattern**

Expand: (x + 4)(x − 4)

Solution:
• F: x × x = x²
• O: x × (−4) = −4x
• I: 4 × x = 4x
• L: 4 × (−4) = −16

Combine: x² − 4x + 4x − 16
Answer: **x² − 16**

(Notice: middle terms cancel!)

**Example 7: Perfect Square Pattern**

Expand: (x + 3)²

This means: (x + 3)(x + 3)

Solution:
• F: x × x = x²
• O: x × 3 = 3x
• I: 3 × x = 3x
• L: 3 × 3 = 9

Combine: x² + 3x + 3x + 9
Answer: **x² + 6x + 9**

**Important Patterns to Remember:**

1. **Single bracket:**
   • a(b + c) = ab + ac

2. **Difference of squares:**
   • (a + b)(a − b) = a² − b²

3. **Perfect square:**
   • (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
   • (a − b)² = a² − 2ab + b²

**Ghana Example:**

Problem: A rectangular farm is (x + 5) meters long and (x + 3) meters wide. Find the area.

Solution:
Area = Length × Width
Area = (x + 5)(x + 3)

Expand:
• x × x = x²
• x × 3 = 3x
• 5 × x = 5x
• 5 × 3 = 15

Area = x² + 3x + 5x + 15
Area = **x² + 8x + 15 square meters**

**Common Mistakes:**
❌ 3(x + 5) = 3x + 5 (WRONG - forgot to multiply 5)
✓ 3(x + 5) = 3x + 15 (CORRECT)

❌ −2(x − 3) = −2x − 3 (WRONG - sign error)
✓ −2(x − 3) = −2x + 6 (CORRECT: −2 × −3 = +6)`

        title: '5. Factorizing Expressions - Finding Common Factors',
        content: `Factorizing (or factoring) is the opposite of expanding. We put brackets back in by finding what's common.

**What is a Factor?**
A factor is a number or expression that divides evenly into another.

Examples:
• 12 = 2 × 6 (2 and 6 are factors)
• 15 = 3 × 5 (3 and 5 are factors)
• 6x = 2 × 3x (2 is a factor)

**Method: Find the Highest Common Factor (HCF)**

**Step 1:** Find the HCF of all coefficients (numbers)
**Step 2:** Find the HCF of all variables (letters)
**Step 3:** Take out the HCF and put remaining terms in brackets

**Example 1: Simple Factorization**

Factorize: 6x + 9

Solution:
Step 1: HCF of 6 and 9 is 3
Step 2: No common variables
Step 3: Take out 3

Check: 6x ÷ 3 = 2x, 9 ÷ 3 = 3
Answer: **3(2x + 3)**

Verify by expanding: 3 × 2x + 3 × 3 = 6x + 9 ✓

**Example 2: With Variables**

Factorize: 4x + 8x²

Solution:
Step 1: HCF of 4 and 8 is 4
Step 2: HCF of x and x² is x
Step 3: Take out 4x

Check: 4x ÷ 4x = 1, 8x² ÷ 4x = 2x
Answer: **4x(1 + 2x)** or **4x(1 + 2x)**

Usually written as: **4x(1 + 2x)**

**Example 3: Three Terms**

Factorize: 12a + 18b − 6c

Solution:
Step 1: HCF of 12, 18, 6 is 6
Step 2: No common variables
Step 3: Take out 6

Check: 12a ÷ 6 = 2a, 18b ÷ 6 = 3b, 6c ÷ 6 = c
Answer: **6(2a + 3b − c)**

**Example 4: All Terms Have Variable**

Factorize: 5x² + 10x

Solution:
Step 1: HCF of 5 and 10 is 5
Step 2: HCF of x² and x is x
Step 3: Take out 5x

Check: 5x² ÷ 5x = x, 10x ÷ 5x = 2
Answer: **5x(x + 2)**

**Example 5: Negative Common Factor**

Factorize: −3x − 6

Solution:
Take out −3:
Answer: **−3(x + 2)**

Or take out 3:
Answer: **3(−x − 2)**

(Both are correct, but first form is usually preferred)

**Example 6: Difference of Two Squares**

Factorize: x² − 25

This is a special pattern: a² − b² = (a + b)(a − b)

Here: x² − 25 = x² − 5²
Answer: **(x + 5)(x − 5)**

**Example 7: Quadratic Trinomial**

Factorize: x² + 7x + 12

Find two numbers that:
• Multiply to give 12
• Add to give 7

Numbers: 3 and 4 (3 × 4 = 12, 3 + 4 = 7)

Answer: **(x + 3)(x + 4)**

Verify: (x + 3)(x + 4) = x² + 4x + 3x + 12 = x² + 7x + 12 ✓

**Special Patterns:**

1. **Difference of squares:**
   • a² − b² = (a + b)(a − b)
   • Example: x² − 9 = (x + 3)(x − 3)

2. **Perfect square trinomial:**
   • a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
   • Example: x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²

3. **Perfect square trinomial (negative):**
   • a² − 2ab + b² = (a − b)²
   • Example: x² − 8x + 16 = (x − 4)²

**Ghana Example:**

Problem: A trader's profit formula is 20x + 30 cedis, where x is the number of items sold. Factorize this expression.

Solution:
HCF of 20 and 30 is 10
20x + 30 = **10(2x + 3)**

This means: Profit = 10 × (2x + 3)
Or: For every item sold, there's a base profit structure.

**Why Factorize?**
• Simplifies complex expressions
• Solves equations (when expression = 0)
• Cancels terms in fractions
• Reveals patterns and relationships
• Essential for WASSCE algebra questions`

3. **Follow BODMAS:**
   • Brackets first
   • Orders (powers) second
   • Division/Multiplication (left to right)
   • Addition/Subtraction (left to right)

4. **Check your signs:**
   • Negative × Positive = Negative
   • Negative × Negative = Positive

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ If x = 5, then x² = 5 × 2 = 10 (WRONG)
✓ If x = 5, then x² = 5 × 5 = 25 (CORRECT)

❌ If x = −3, then 2x = 2 − 3 = −1 (WRONG)
✓ If x = −3, then 2x = 2(−3) = −6 (CORRECT)

    summary: 'Algebraic expressions use letters (variables) to represent unknown values. Key components include: variables (x, y), coefficients (numbers multiplying variables), constants (standalone numbers), and terms (parts separated by + or −). Like terms have the same variables with the same powers and can be combined by adding/subtracting coefficients. Unlike terms have different variables or powers and cannot be combined. To simplify expressions, combine like terms. To expand, use the distributive law: a(b + c) = ab + ac. To factorize, find the highest common factor (HCF) and take it outside brackets. Substitution means replacing variables with numbers to evaluate expressions. Word problems require translating English phrases into algebraic expressions using keywords (more than = +, less than = −, times = ×, divided by = ÷). Master these skills for WASSCE algebra success!'

    introduction: `An equation is a mathematical statement showing that two expressions are equal, using the = sign. Solving an equation means finding the value of the unknown variable that makes the equation true.

Equations are everywhere in daily life:
• **Shopping:** If 5 items cost GH₵100, what's the cost per item? (5x = 100)
• **Transport:** A taxi charges GH₵8 base fare plus GH₵2 per km. For GH₵24, how far can you go? (8 + 2x = 24)
• **Mobile data:** If 3GB plus GH₵10 airtime costs GH₵40, what's the cost per GB? (3x + 10 = 40)
• **Time management:** If you study x hours daily and want 20 hours per week, how many hours daily? (7x = 20)

Inequalities show relationships where one side is greater than or less than the other, using symbols: > (greater than), < (less than), ≥ (greater than or equal to), ≤ (less than or equal to).

Real-world inequality examples:
• **Budget:** Total spending must be less than GH₵500 → x < 500
• **Age requirements:** Must be at least 16 years to get a license → x ≥ 16
• **Speed limits:** Cannot exceed 50 km/h in town → x ≤ 50

Mastering equations and inequalities is crucial for WASSCE success and for solving practical problems in science, engineering, economics, and everyday decision-making.`,

        content: `An **equation** is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal, separated by an equals sign (=).

**Parts of an Equation:**

1. **Left-Hand Side (LHS):** Expression before the = sign
2. **Right-Hand Side (RHS):** Expression after the = sign
3. **Variable:** The unknown we're solving for (usually x, y, or z)
4. **Solution:** The value that makes the equation true

**Example:** 2x + 3 = 11

• LHS: 2x + 3
• RHS: 11
• Variable: x
• Solution: x = 4 (because 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ✓)

**Types of Equations:**

**1. Simple Equations (one operation)**
• x + 5 = 12
• 3x = 15
• x/4 = 3
• x − 7 = 10

**2. Two-Step Equations**
• 2x + 5 = 13
• 3x − 7 = 14
• x/2 + 3 = 10

**3. Multi-Step Equations**
• 4(x + 3) = 20
• 5x + 2 = 3x + 10
• (x + 5)/2 = 7

**The Golden Rule of Equations:**
**"Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other side"**

This keeps the equation balanced (like a scale).

**Checking Your Answer:**
Always substitute your answer back into the original equation to verify.

Example: If x = 4 in equation 2x + 3 = 11
Check: 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ✓ Correct!

• If −2x < 10 and we try x = 6: −12 < 10 ✓ (true)
• After dividing: x > −5, and 6 > −5 ✓ (true)
• Without flipping: x < −5, but 6 is NOT < −5 (contradiction!)

**Example 6:** −3x + 5 ≥ 14

Solution:
Step 1: Subtract 5
• −3x ≥ 9

Step 2: Divide by −3 (FLIP!)
• x ≤ −3

Meaning: x is −3 or less

**Example 7: Variables on Both Sides**

Solve: 5x − 3 < 2x + 9

Solution:
Step 1: Subtract 2x
• 3x − 3 < 9

Step 2: Add 3
• 3x < 12

Step 3: Divide by 3
• x < 4

Meaning: x is less than 4

**Compound Inequalities:**

**Example 8:** 3 < x + 2 < 10

Solution:
Subtract 2 from all parts:
• 3 − 2 < x + 2 − 2 < 10 − 2
• 1 < x < 9

Meaning: x is between 1 and 9 (exclusive)

**Example 9:** −5 ≤ 2x − 1 ≤ 7

Solution:
Step 1: Add 1 to all parts
• −4 ≤ 2x ≤ 8

Step 2: Divide all parts by 2
• −2 ≤ x ≤ 4

Meaning: x is between −2 and 4 (inclusive)

"will have equal amounts" must mean:\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(a + 200) − 50 = a + 50\na + 150 = a + 50\n\nThis is impossible! The problem setup is inconsistent.\n\nLet me try interpreting differently: Perhaps "equal amounts" means their difference becomes zero?\n\nKwame − Ama after transfer:\n(k − 50) − (a + 50) = 0\nk − 50 − a − 50 = 0\nk − a = 100\n\nBut initially k − a = 200\n\nSo: a + 200 − a = 100 becomes 200 = 100 (contradiction)\n\nCORRECT INTERPRETATION:\nAfter Kwame gives GH₵50, the difference reduces.\n\nActually, let me solve properly:\n(x + 200) − 50 = x + 50\nx + 150 = x + 50\n\nOH! I see the error.

The problem as stated is mathematically impossible.\n\nPERHAPS: "equal amounts" means the gap closes?\n\nCorrect Solution:\nLet x = amount Ama has\nKwame has x + 200\n\nAfter Kwame gives GH₵50 to Ama, they have equal money:\n(x + 200 − 50) = (x + 50)\nx + 150 = x + 50\n\nThis simplifies to 150 = 50, which is false.\n\nThe problem is incorrectly worded. However, if we assume "they will have equal amounts" means the FINAL amounts are equal:\n\nLet original amounts be: Ama = a, Kwame = a + 200\nAfter transfer: Ama = a + 50, Kwame = a + 200 − 50 = a + 150\n\nFor them to be equal:\na + 50 = a + 150 is impossible.\n\nCORRECT PROBLEM SHOULD BE:\n"Kwame has GH₵200 more than Ama. If Kwame gives GH₵x to Ama, they will have equal amounts. Find x."\n\nSolution:\n(a + 200 − x) = (a + x)\na + 200 − x = a + x\n200 = 2x\nx = 100\n\nSo Kwame should give GH₵100, not GH₵50.\n\nIF the problem says GH₵50, then:\nAma initially: GH₵50\nKwame initially: GH₵250\nAfter transfer: Ama = 100, Kwame = 200 (not equal)\n\nAnswer: The problem as stated contains an error. If Kwame gives GH₵100 (not 50), then Ama has GH₵50 and Kwame has GH₵250 initially.'

    summary: 'Linear equations show equality between two expressions (ax + b = c) and are solved by isolating the variable using inverse operations. Key principles: (1) Whatever you do to one side, do to the other; (2) Check your answer by substitution. Two-step equations require undoing operations in reverse order. When variables appear on both sides, collect all variables on one side and constants on the other. For fractions, multiply by LCD to clear denominators. Inequalities use <, >, ≤, ≥ symbols and follow the same rules as equations except: when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, FLIP the inequality sign. Graph inequality solutions using open circles (< or >) or closed circles (≤ or ≥). Word problems require translating English to mathematical equations using keywords: "is" = equals, "more than" = add, "less than" = subtract, "times" = multiply, "divided by" = divide. Always define your variable, set up the equation carefully, solve systematically, and check your answer. These skills are essential for WASSCE success and real-world problem solving!'

    introduction: `Directed numbers are numbers that have both size (magnitude) and direction (positive or negative). They extend our number system beyond zero to include negative values.

Think of directed numbers in everyday life in Ghana:
• **Temperature:** 30°C is hot (positive), but a freezer might be -5°C (negative).
• **Business:** Profit is positive (+GH₵500), while Loss is negative (-GH₵200).
• **Elevation:** Mountain Afadjato is above sea level (+885m), while a submarine is below sea level (-100m).
• **Banking:** A credit balance is positive, while a debt or overdraft is negative.
• **Elevators:** Ground floor is 0, floors up are +1, +2, basement floors are -1, -2.

The **Number Line** is a visual tool where zero is the center. Positive numbers are to the right (increasing), and negative numbers are to the left (decreasing).

Mastering directed numbers is fundamental for Algebra, Science, and higher mathematics.`,

        title: '1. The Number Line and Ordering',
        content: `A **Number Line** is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals.

\`\`\`
<───|───|───|───|───|───|───|───|───|───|───>
   -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5
\`\`\`

**Key Features:**
• **Zero (0):** The origin. Neither positive nor negative.
• **Positive Numbers:** To the right of zero (+1, +2, +3...). Often written without the + sign.
• **Negative Numbers:** To the left of zero (-1, -2, -3...). Must have the - sign.
• **Opposites:** Numbers same distance from zero but opposite sides (e.g., -3 and 3).

**Ordering Numbers:**
• Numbers get **larger** as you move **RIGHT**.
• Numbers get **smaller** as you move **LEFT**.

**Comparisons:**
• 5 > 2 (5 is to the right of 2)
• -2 > -5 (-2 is to the right of -5)
• -10 < 0 (-10 is to the left of 0)
• -1 < 1 (-1 is to the left of 1)

**Note:** With negative numbers, the one that "looks" bigger is actually smaller.

**Rules:**
1. **Start** at the first number.
2. **Add Positive:** Move RIGHT.
3. **Add Negative:** Move LEFT.

**Case 1: Positive + Positive**
• 3 + 2 = 5
• Start at 3, move 2 steps right → 5

**Case 2: Negative + Positive**
• -4 + 3 = -1
• Start at -4, move 3 steps right → -1
• Think: "I owe GH₵4, I pay GH₵3, I still owe GH₵1"

**Case 3: Positive + Negative**
• 5 + (-2) is same as 5 - 2
• Start at 5, move 2 steps left → 3
• Rule: **Plus followed by Minus becomes Minus (+ - → -)**

**Case 4: Negative + Negative**
• -3 + (-2) is same as -3 - 2
• Start at -3, move 2 steps left → -5
• Think: "I owe GH₵3, I borrow GH₵2 more, total debt GH₵5"

**Summary Rule for Addition:**
• Same signs: Add the numbers, keep the sign.
  • (+3) + (+4) = +7
  • (-3) + (-4) = -7
• Different signs: Subtract smaller from larger, keep sign of the larger number.
  • (-7) + 3 → 7-3=4, larger is negative → -4

**The Double Negative Rule:**
• Subtracting a negative is the same as ADDING.
• **Minus followed by Minus becomes Plus (- - → +)**
• Think: "Taking away a debt is like gaining money."

**Examples:**

**1. Positive - Positive**
• 5 - 3 = 2 (Move 3 left from 5)
• 3 - 5 = -2 (Move 5 left from 3)

**2. Negative - Positive**
• -3 - 2 = -5
• Start at -3, move 2 left → -5
• Think: "Temperature is -3°, drops 2° more → -5°"

• 5 - (-2) becomes 5 + 2 = 7
• Start at 5, move 2 RIGHT → 7

**4. Negative - Negative (The Switch)**
• -5 - (-3) becomes -5 + 3
• Start at -5, move 3 RIGHT → -2
• -2 - (-5) becomes -2 + 5 = 3

**Ghana Market Analogy:**
• If you have a debt of GH₵10 (-10) and the shopkeeper cancels (subtracts) GH₵4 of the debt (-4).
• Calculation: -10 - (-4) = -10 + 4 = -6.

• |0| = 0

**Examples:**
• |5| = 5
• |-5| = 5

• |100| = 100

**Operations with Absolute Value:**
Treat absolute value bars like brackets. Evaluate what's inside first.

• Inside: -3 + 7 = 4
• |4| = 4

**Example 2:** |-3| + |7|

    summary: 'Directed numbers include both positive and negative numbers and are represented on a number line with zero at the center. Numbers to the right are positive/larger, and to the left are negative/smaller. Addition involves moving right (for positive) or left (for negative). Subtraction involves moving in the opposite direction, where subtracting a negative becomes addition (- - = +). Multiplication and division follow sign rules: same signs give positive, different signs give negative. Absolute value |x| is the positive distance from zero. Order of operations (BODMAS) applies strictly to directed numbers. These concepts are essential for all advanced mathematics.'

    introduction: `In real life, we don't always need exact numbers. Sometimes, an approximate value is good enough or even better because it's easier to remember and work with.

**Why Approximation Matters:**
• **Money:** If a car costs GH₵149,950, we say "about GH₵150,000".
• **Population:** Ghana's population is "about 33 million" (not exactly 33,475,870).
• **Science:** The distance to the sun is "about 150 million km".
• **Shopping:** Estimating your total bill before you get to the cashier to ensure you have enough money.

**Approximation** is finding a value that is close enough to the right answer.
**Estimation** is making a rough calculation to check if an answer makes sense.

This lesson covers the rules for rounding numbers, using significant figures, and working with standard form—skills that are tested in almost every WASSCE Core Maths paper.`,

        title: '1. Rounding to Whole Numbers and Powers of 10',
        content: `**The General Rule for Rounding:**
1. Identify the digit at the place value you are rounding to.
2. Look at the **next digit** to the right (the "decider").
3. If the decider is **5 or more** (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), **round UP** (add 1 to the target digit).
4. If the decider is **4 or less** (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), **round DOWN** (keep the target digit the same).
5. Replace all digits to the right with zeros (for whole numbers) or drop them (for decimals).

**Rounding to Nearest Whole Number:**
Look at the first decimal digit (tenths).
• 4.3 → 4 (3 is < 5)
• 4.8 → 5 (8 is ≥ 5)
• 12.5 → 13 (5 is ≥ 5)

**Rounding to Nearest 10, 100, 1000:**

**Example 1: Round 3,487**
• Nearest 10: Target is 8 (tens). Next is 7 (≥5). Round up 8 to 9.
  • Answer: **3,490**
• Nearest 100: Target is 4 (hundreds). Next is 8 (≥5). Round up 4 to 5.
  • Answer: **3,500**
• Nearest 1000: Target is 3 (thousands). Next is 4 (<5). Keep 3.
  • Answer: **3,000**

**Example 2: Round 29,501**

        title: '3. Significant Figures (s.f.)',
        content: `Significant figures (sig figs) measure the precision of a number starting from the first non-zero digit.

**Rules for Counting Sig Figs:**
1. **Non-zero digits** are ALWAYS significant. (e.g., 45 has 2 s.f.)
2. **Zeros between** non-zero digits are significant. (e.g., 405 has 3 s.f.)
3. **Leading zeros** (at the start) are NEVER significant. They just place the decimal. (e.g., 0.0045 has 2 s.f.)
4. **Trailing zeros** (at the end) in a decimal number are significant. (e.g., 4.50 has 3 s.f.)
5. Trailing zeros in a whole number are usually NOT significant unless specified (ambiguous).

**Examples of Counting:**
• 345 (3 s.f.)
• 0.00345 (3 s.f. - start counting at 3)
• 30045 (5 s.f. - zeros in middle count)
• 3.450 (4 s.f. - zero at end of decimal counts)

**Rounding to Significant Figures:**
Start counting from the first non-zero digit.

**Example 1: Round 0.004582 to 2 s.f.**
• 1st s.f. is 4. 2nd s.f. is 5.
• Next digit is 8 (Round up).
• 5 becomes 6.
• Answer: **0.0046**

**Example 2: Round 54,789 to 2 s.f.**
• 1st s.f. is 5. 2nd s.f. is 4.
• Next digit is 7 (Round up).
• 4 becomes 5.
• Fill remaining places with zeros.
• Answer: **55,000**

**Example 3: Round 0.03049 to 2 s.f.**
• 1st s.f. is 3. 2nd s.f. is 0.
• Next digit is 4 (Stay).

        content: `Estimation helps check if a calculator answer is reasonable.

**Strategy:** Round each number to **1 significant figure** before calculating.

**Example 1: Estimate $48 \\times 5.2$**
• Round 48 → 50
• Round 5.2 → 5
• Estimate: $50 \\times 5 = 250$
• (Exact answer is 249.6, so estimate is very close)

**Example 2: Estimate $\\frac{304 \\times 19.5}{0.48}$**
• Round 304 → 300
• Round 19.5 → 20
• Round 0.48 → 0.5
• Calculation: $\\frac{300 \\times 20}{0.5} = \\frac{6000}{0.5}$
• Dividing by 0.5 is same as multiplying by 2.
• Estimate: 12,000

**Example 3: Estimate cost of 28 items at GH₵4.95 each**
• Round 28 → 30
• Round 4.95 → 5
• Estimate: $30 \\times 5 = 150$

    summary: 'Approximation and estimation are vital skills for checking results and handling real-world data. Rounding reduces precision to make numbers easier to use (nearest 10, 100, etc.). Decimal places count digits after the point, while significant figures measure precision starting from the first non-zero digit. Standard form ($A \\times 10^n$) is used for very large or small numbers. Estimation involves rounding to 1 significant figure to perform quick mental checks. Percentage error quantifies the accuracy of a measurement. Mastering these ensures you can validate calculator answers and report data to appropriate levels of accuracy.'

    introduction: `Factors and multiples are the building blocks of arithmetic. They help us break down numbers, simplify fractions, and solve scheduling problems.

**Key Definitions:**
• **Factor:** A number that divides another number exactly (no remainder).
  • Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
• **Multiple:** A number obtained by multiplying a number by an integer.
  • Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15...
• **Prime Number:** A number with exactly two factors: 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
  • Note: 1 is NOT a prime number.

**Real-Life Applications:**
• **HCF:** Tiling a floor with the largest possible square tiles; dividing items into equal gift bags.
• **LCM:** Determining when two events will happen at the same time (e.g., two bells ringing together, traffic lights synchronizing).

This lesson covers the essential techniques for finding HCF and LCM and using divisibility rules to work faster.`,

**Method: Factor Tree**
Example: Find prime factors of 60.
1. Break 60 into any two factors: $6 \\times 10$
2. Break 6 into primes: $2 \\times 3$
3. Break 10 into primes: $2 \\times 5$
4. Collect all primes: $2, 3, 2, 5$
5. Write in index form: $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5$

**Method: Repeated Division**
Divide by smallest primes (2, 3, 5...) until you reach 1.
• $60 \\div 2 = 30$
• $30 \\div 2 = 15$
• $15 \\div 3 = 5$

• Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, **6**, 9, 18
• Common Factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
• Highest: **6**

**Method 2: Prime Factorization (Best for large numbers)**

    introduction: `Geometry (from Greek "geo" = earth, "metron" = measure) is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and properties of space. It is the foundation of architecture, engineering, art, and navigation.

**Why Study Lines and Angles?**
• **Construction:** Every building stands because of precise angles (90° for walls, specific angles for roofs).
• **Design:** From fashion to graphic design, angles create visual harmony.
• **Navigation:** Pilots and sailors use bearings (angles) to find their way.
• **Sports:** A footballer calculates the angle to shoot a goal; a snooker player calculates the angle of impact.

In this lesson, we will start from the very basics—points and lines—and build up to solving complex problems involving parallel lines. These concepts are tested in **every single WASSCE Core Maths paper**, often in the compulsory section. Mastering them is non-negotiable!`,
    keyConcepts: [
      {
        title: '1. Basic Geometric Elements',
        content: `Before we measure angles, we must understand the building blocks.

1. **Point:** An exact location in space. It has no size, only position. Represented by a dot and a capital letter (e.g., Point A).
2. **Line:** A straight path that extends forever in both directions. It has no thickness.
3. **Ray:** A part of a line that starts at a point (endpoint) and extends forever in one direction.
4. **Line Segment:** A part of a line between two endpoints. It has a measurable length.
5. **Plane:** A flat surface that extends forever (like an infinite floor).
6. **Parallel Lines:** Lines in the same plane that never meet, no matter how far they are extended. Marked with arrows (>>).
7. **Perpendicular Lines:** Lines that meet at a right angle (90°). Marked with a small square.`
      },
      {
        title: '2. Types of Angles',
        content: `An **angle** is formed when two rays meet at a point (vertex). Angles are measured in degrees (°).

**Classification by Size:**

1. **Acute Angle:** Less than 90° ($0° < x < 90°$). "Sharp" angle.
2. **Right Angle:** Exactly 90°. Like the corner of a book.
3. **Obtuse Angle:** Between 90° and 180° ($90° < x < 180°$). "Blunt" angle.
4. **Straight Angle:** Exactly 180°. A straight line.
5. **Reflex Angle:** Between 180° and 360° ($180° < x < 360°$). The "outside" angle.
6. **Full Rotation (Perigon):** Exactly 360°. A complete circle.

**Visual Guide:**
• Acute: V shape
• Right: L shape
• Obtuse: Wide opening
• Straight: Flat line`
      },
      {
        title: '3. Angle Pairs and Relationships',
        content: `Some angles have special relationships when they appear together.

**1. Complementary Angles:**
Two angles that add up to **90°**.
• Example: 30° and 60° are complementary.
• If angle $x$ is complementary to 40°, then $x = 90 - 40 = 50°$.

**2. Supplementary Angles:**
Two angles that add up to **180°**.
• Example: 110° and 70° are supplementary.
• If angle $y$ is supplementary to 120°, then $y = 180 - 120 = 60°$.

**3. Adjacent Angles:**
Angles that share a common vertex and a common side, but do not overlap. They are "neighbors".

**4. Vertically Opposite Angles:**
When two lines intersect (cross), the angles opposite each other are **EQUAL**.
• They form an X shape.
• If top angle is 50°, bottom is 50°.
• If left angle is 130°, right is 130°.`
      },
      {
        title: '4. Angles on a Line and at a Point',
        content: `**Theorem 1: Angles on a Straight Line**
The sum of angles on a straight line is **180°**.
• If a straight line is split into two angles $a$ and $b$, then $a + b = 180°$.
• If split into three angles $a, b, c$, then $a + b + c = 180°$.

**Example:** Find $x$ if angles on a line are $2x, 3x, 4x$.
• $2x + 3x + 4x = 180$
• $9x = 180$
• $x = 20°$

**Theorem 2: Angles at a Point**
The sum of angles around a single point (making a full circle) is **360°**.
• $a + b + c + d = 360°$.

**Example:** Find $y$ if angles at a point are 90°, 120°, $y$.
• $90 + 120 + y = 360$
• $210 + y = 360$
• $y = 360 - 210 = 150°$`
      },
      {
        title: '5. Parallel Lines and Transversals',
        content: `A **transversal** is a line that crosses two or more parallel lines. This creates special angle pairs with powerful properties.

**1. Corresponding Angles (F-Shape):**
• Angles in the same position at each intersection.
• They are **EQUAL**.
• Look for an **F** shape (can be backward or upside down).

**2. Alternate Angles (Z-Shape):**
• Angles on opposite sides of the transversal and between the parallel lines.
• They are **EQUAL**.
• Look for a **Z** shape.

**3. Interior (Co-interior) Angles (C-Shape):**
• Angles on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines.
• They **ADD UP TO 180°** (Supplementary).
• Look for a **C** or **U** shape.

**Summary:**
• **F** angles are Equal.
• **Z** angles are Equal.
• **C** angles sum to 180°.`
      },
      {
        title: '6. Solving Geometric Problems',
        content: `To solve geometry problems effectively:

1. **Identify the Rules:** Look for straight lines (180°), full circles (360°), X-shapes (vertically opposite), and parallel lines (F, Z, C shapes).
2. **Show Your Work:** In WASSCE Section B, you must state the reason for each step.
   • e.g., "$x = 50°$ (Alt. angles)"
   • e.g., "$y + 120 = 180$ (Int. angles)"
3. **Don't Trust the Diagram:** Diagrams are often "not drawn to scale". Rely on the numbers and markings (arrows for parallel, squares for 90°), not what it looks like.
4. **Algebra in Geometry:** Often you'll get equations like $2x + 10$ and $3x - 20$. Set up the equation based on the relationship (are they equal? do they sum to 180?) and solve for $x$.`

    introduction: `Triangles (3 sides) and Quadrilaterals (4 sides) are the most common shapes in geometry. From the trusses of a roof (triangles) to the screen of your phone (rectangle), these shapes are everywhere.

**Why are Triangles so important?**
Triangles are the strongest shape because they cannot be deformed without changing the length of a side. This is why bridges and cranes are built using triangles.

**Why are Quadrilaterals so important?**
Most rooms, windows, doors, and plots of land are quadrilaterals (usually rectangles) because they tessellate (fit together) perfectly without gaps.

In this lesson, we will explore the "DNA" of these shapes—their side lengths and angle properties—and learn how to calculate missing values.`,

Triangles are congruent if they are exactly the same shape and size. If you cut one out, it fits perfectly on the other.

**Conditions for Congruency:**
1. **SSS (Side-Side-Side):** All three corresponding sides are equal.
2. **SAS (Side-Angle-Side):** Two sides and the *included* angle are equal.
3. **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle):** Two angles and the *included* side are equal.
4. **RHS (Right-Hypotenuse-Side):** In right-angled triangles, the hypotenuse and one other side are equal.

**B. Similar Triangles ($\sim$)**
Triangles are similar if they have the same shape but different sizes (one is an enlargement of the other).

**Properties:**
1.  **Corresponding Angles are Equal:** $\angle A = \angle P, \angle B = \angle Q, \angle C = \angle R$.
2.  **Ratio of Corresponding Sides is Constant:**
    $$ \frac{AB}{PQ} = \frac{BC}{QR} = \frac{AC}{PR} = k $$
    (where $k$ is the scale factor).

**Example:**
Triangle ABC has sides 3, 4, 5. Triangle PQR is similar to ABC and its shortest side is 6. Find the other sides.
• Ratio = $6/3 = 2$.
• Other sides = $4 \times 2 = 8$ and $5 \times 2 = 10$.`

    introduction: `Geometric Construction is the art of drawing accurate shapes using only two tools: a **straightedge** (ruler) and a **pair of compasses**. Unlike sketching, construction requires precise measurements and specific steps to prove that a shape is correct.

In the WASSCE Core Math exam, Construction is often a full question in Section B. It tests your ability to follow instructions precisely and understand the geometric rules that govern shapes.

**Why is this important?**
• **Engineering & Architecture:** Blueprints and designs rely on the principles of geometric construction.
• **Navigation:** Understanding loci is essential for plotting courses and boundaries.
• **Exam Strategy:** Construction questions are "mechanical" - if you follow the steps and are neat, you can get full marks easily.

In this lesson, we will master the fundamental skills: bisecting lines and angles, constructing specific angles, and understanding the "Locus" of points.`,
    keyConcepts: [
      {
        title: '1. The Tools and Rules',
        content: `To perform constructions, you need:
1.  **Pair of Compasses:** For drawing circles and arcs. Ensure the pencil is sharp and the hinge is tight.
2.  **Straightedge (Ruler):** For drawing straight lines.
3.  **Pencil:** Use a hard pencil (2H or H) for construction lines (faint) and a softer pencil (HB) for outlines (bold).

**The Golden Rules:**
• **Never erase your construction arcs.** Examiners look for these "working lines" to give you marks.
• **Be precise.** A difference of 1mm or 1° can lose you marks.
• **Label clearly.** Mark points with capital letters (A, B, C) as instructed.`

**Why is this important?**
• **Decision Making:** Governments use census data to plan for schools and hospitals.
• **Business:** Companies use sales data to know what products customers like.
• **Research:** Scientists use data to test new medicines.

In this lesson, you will learn the first steps of statistics: how to gather data correctly and how to present it in clear, visual ways like charts and graphs. This is a guaranteed topic in WASSCE Core Maths!`,

**A. Source of Data:**
1. **Primary Data:** Data collected by YOU for a specific purpose.
   • *Examples:* Measuring heights of your classmates, conducting a survey in your school.
   • *Pros:* Accurate, specific. *Cons:* Time-consuming, expensive.
2. **Secondary Data:** Data collected by SOMEONE ELSE that you use.
   • *Examples:* Census reports from Ghana Statistical Service, weather records from the internet.
   • *Pros:* Cheap, fast. *Cons:* May be outdated or not exactly what you need.

**B. Nature of Data (Quantitative):**
1. **Discrete Data:** Data that is **COUNTED**. It can only take specific values (whole numbers).
   • *Examples:* Number of students in a class (can't have 2.5 students), shoe size, number of cars.
2. **Continuous Data:** Data that is **MEASURED**. It can take ANY value within a range.

(a) Calculate the sector angle for the mark "3".
(b) What percentage of students scored 4 or 5?

**Solution:**

**(a) Sector Angle for Mark "3"**
• Total Frequency = 40 (Given)
• Frequency for Mark "3" = 12
• Formula: $\\text{Angle} = \\frac{\\text{Frequency}}{\\text{Total Frequency}} \\times 360^\\circ$
• Calculation: $\\frac{12}{40} \\times 360^\\circ = 12 \\times 9^\\circ = 108^\\circ$

**(b) Percentage of students scoring 4 or 5**
• Students scoring 4 = 10
• Students scoring 5 = 7
• Total students scoring 4 or 5 = $10 + 7 = 17$
• Percentage = $\\frac{17}{40} \\times 100\\%$

• Will it rain today?
• What are the chances of winning the lottery?
• If I toss a coin, will it be Heads or Tails?

In Ghana, we use probability all the time without thinking about it. When a trotro driver decides to wait for more passengers, he is calculating the probability of getting a full load quickly!

**The Golden Rule:**
Probability is always a number between **0** and **1**.
• **0** means Impossible (It will never happen).
• **1** means Certain (It will definitely happen).
• **0.5** (or 1/2) means Evens (50-50 chance).

• Favorable outcome (getting Heads): 1.

**The Multiplication Law:**
If events A and B are independent:
$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$$

*Example:* You toss a coin and roll a die. What is the probability of getting **Heads** AND a **6**?
• $P(\\text{Heads}) = \\frac{1}{2}$
• $P(6) = \\frac{1}{6}$
• $P(\\text{Heads and } 6) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$`

        title: '4. Tree Diagrams',
        content: `A Tree Diagram is a drawing that helps you list all possible outcomes of two or more events. It is very useful for "with replacement" and "without replacement" problems.

**Structure:**
• Branches represent the possible outcomes.
• Write the probability on each branch.
• Multiply along the branches to get the probability of that path (AND).
• Add the final probabilities of different paths to get the total probability (OR).

*Example:* A bag has 3 Red and 2 Blue balls. You pick two balls **with replacement** (you put the first one back).
• **First Pick:** Red (3/5), Blue (2/5).
• **Second Pick:** Red (3/5), Blue (2/5) (Probabilities stay the same).
• $P(\\text{Red, Red}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{9}{25}$.

    summary: 'Probability helps us understand the world of chance. We learned that probability is always between 0 and 1. We used the basic formula (Favorable/Total) to solve simple problems. We also learned the two big rules: The Addition Law (OR) for mutually exclusive events, and the Multiplication Law (AND) for independent events. Finally, we saw how Tree Diagrams can help us map out complex situations. Remember, while we can calculate probability, in real life (experimental), anything can happen in the short term!'

    "introduction": "Water (H₂O) is the most abundant substance on Earth and is essential for all known forms of life. Sometimes we need to chemically confirm the presence of water in a sample. Two simple and reliable chemical tests can identify water through observable color changes.",

        "title": "Anhydrous Compounds",
        "content": "The term 'anhydrous' comes from Greek: 'an' (without) + 'hydro' (water). Anhydrous compounds have had all water molecules removed and are in a dry state. These compounds can absorb water from their surroundings and become 'hydrated,' often with a visible change in their properties."

      {
        "title": "Anhydrous Copper(II) Sulfate Test",
        "content": "White anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄) is one of the most reliable tests for water. When water is added, the compound turns bright blue as it forms hydrated copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄·5H₂O). The reaction combines one copper sulfate molecule with five water molecules in a crystal structure called a pentahydrate.\n\nChemical equation: CuSO₄ (white) + 5H₂O → CuSO₄·5H₂O (blue)\n\nThis test is highly specific for water and won't produce false positives with other liquids. The blue color appears immediately and is very distinctive."

        "title": "Cobalt(II) Chloride Paper Test",
        "content": "Blue cobalt(II) chloride paper is extremely sensitive to water. When water touches the blue paper, it turns pink almost instantly. This test can detect even small amounts of water vapor in the air.\n\nAnhydrous cobalt chloride (CoCl₂) is blue, while the hydrated form is pink. The color change is reversible - if you heat the pink paper to drive off the water, it turns blue again.\n\nThis test is so sensitive that cobalt chloride is used in silica gel packets (the little bags in shoe boxes) to indicate when the moisture-absorbing gel is saturated."

      {
        "title": "The Chemistry of Hydration",
        "content": "When anhydrous compounds absorb water, the process is called hydration. Water molecules form coordinate bonds with metal ions in the compound's crystal lattice. This changes the electronic structure around the metal ions, which affects how they absorb and reflect light.\n\nIn copper sulfate:\n- Anhydrous form: No water molecules, appears white\n- Hydrated form: 5 water molecules per CuSO₄, appears blue\n\nIn cobalt chloride:\n- Anhydrous form: No water molecules, appears blue  \n- Hydrated form: 6 water molecules per CoCl₂, appears pink\n\nThe color we see is the light that isn't absorbed. When the electronic structure changes, different wavelengths are absorbed or reflected, producing the color change we observe."

      {
        "title": "Crystal Water",
        "content": "Water that is chemically bound within a crystal structure is called 'water of crystallization' or 'crystal water.' In CuSO₄·5H₂O, the '·5H₂O' notation indicates five water molecules are part of the crystal structure. These aren't just mixed with the compound - they're actually bonded to it.\n\nMany compounds can exist in both anhydrous and hydrated forms. The hydrated forms are often more stable at room temperature, while the anhydrous forms must be stored in sealed containers to prevent them from absorbing moisture from the air."

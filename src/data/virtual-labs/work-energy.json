    "introduction": "The Law of Conservation of Energy is one of the most fundamental principles in physics. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed - it can only be transformed from one form to another. When you drop a ball, lift a weight, or ride a roller coaster, you're witnessing this law in action as energy continuously transforms between potential and kinetic forms.",

        "content": "In a closed system, the total amount of energy remains constant. Energy can change forms - chemical to electrical, thermal to mechanical, potential to kinetic - but the total quantity never changes.\n\nThis law applies universally, from subatomic particles to galaxies. It's the foundation for understanding everything from simple pendulums to nuclear reactors to the entire universe's evolution.\n\nIn this lab, we focus on mechanical energy - the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. Ignoring friction and air resistance, the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant as objects move and interact."

        "content": "Potential energy is stored energy due to an object's position or configuration. It's the energy an object has because of where it is or how it's arranged.\n\nGravitational Potential Energy:\nThe formula is PE = mgh, where:\n- m = mass (in kilograms)\n- g = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s² on Earth)\n- h = height above a reference point (in meters)\n\nThe higher an object is, the more gravitational potential energy it has. Think of it as 'stored' energy waiting to be released. When you lift a book onto a shelf, you do work against gravity, and that work is stored as potential energy.\n\nImportant points:\n- PE is always measured relative to some reference point (usually the ground)\n- Doubling the height doubles the potential energy\n- Doubling the mass doubles the potential energy\n- PE is measured in Joules (J) in the SI system\n- 1 Joule = 1 Newton × 1 meter = 1 kg⋅m²/s²\n\nExamples:\n- Water behind a dam has enormous PE due to its height\n- A wound-up spring has elastic potential energy\n- A drawn bow has potential energy stored in the bent material"

        "title": "Kinetic Energy (KE)",
        "content": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Any object that is moving has kinetic energy. The faster it moves, the more kinetic energy it has.\n\nThe formula is KE = ½mv², where:\n- m = mass (in kilograms)\n- v = velocity or speed (in meters per second)\n- The ½ factor comes from calculus (integrating F = ma)\n\nKey observations:\n- KE depends on the square of velocity. This means doubling the speed quadruples the kinetic energy!\n- A 2 kg object moving at 10 m/s has the same KE as a 1 kg object moving at 14.14 m/s\n- KE is always positive (or zero) because velocity is squared\n- Like PE, KE is measured in Joules\n\nThe v² relationship has important implications:\n- Stopping a car going 100 km/h requires four times more braking distance than stopping one going 50 km/h\n- Faster-moving objects in collisions cause much more damage\n- Wind energy increases dramatically with wind speed\n\nExamples:\n- A speeding car has significant KE (which is why crashes are so destructive)\n- Flowing water has KE used to turn turbines\n- Your body has KE when you run or jump"

        "content": "When an object falls under gravity (ignoring air resistance), potential energy continuously converts to kinetic energy:\n\nAt the top:\n- Maximum PE (mgh)\n- Zero KE (not moving yet)\n- Total Energy = mgh\n\nHalfway down:\n- PE reduced to mgh/2 (height is h/2)\n- KE increased to mgh/2 (gained from lost PE)\n- Total Energy = mgh (constant!)\n\nAt the bottom:\n- Zero PE (no height)\n- Maximum KE (maximum speed)\n- Total Energy = ½mv² = mgh\n\nThe transformation is smooth and continuous. At every point during the fall, PE + KE = constant. This is the Law of Conservation of Energy in action.\n\nInteresting fact: The mass cancels out when calculating final speed! If you drop a feather and a hammer from the same height in a vacuum, they hit the ground at exactly the same time with the same speed (Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott demonstrated this on the Moon)."

This is why all objects (in a vacuum) fall at the same rate.\n\nExamples:\n- Object falling from 5 m: v = √(2 × 9.81 × 5) = 9.9 m/s\n- Object falling from 20 m: v = √(2 × 9.81 × 20) = 19.8 m/s (exactly double)\n- Doubling height increases speed by √2 ≈ 1.414"

In physics, work is done when a force moves an object through a distance:\n\nWork (W) = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\nWhere θ is the angle between force and motion\n\nWhen you lift an object of mass m through height h, you do work against gravity:\nW = F × d = mg × h = mgh\n\nThis work is stored as potential energy! The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy:\n\nW = ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial\n\nThis connects work (force × distance) with energy changes. When gravity does positive work on a falling object, it gains kinetic energy. When you do work lifting an object, it gains potential energy.\n\nImportant distinctions:\n- In everyday language, 'work' means any effort. In physics, holding a heavy object stationary is NOT work (no motion)\n- Only the component of force in the direction of motion does work\n- Work is measured in Joules, same unit as energy"

One horsepower = 746 watts, representing the power of a typical working horse."

      "definition": "The rate of energy transfer or work done. Power = Energy/Time. Measured in Watts (W). 1 Watt = 1 Joule/second."

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Confusing speed and velocity with energy",
      "why": "Energy is not the same as speed. Energy depends on speed squared (KE = ½mv²), so doubling speed quadruples energy",
      "solution": "Remember: energy is measured in Joules, speed in m/s. They're related but different physical quantities."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Thinking doubling height doubles final speed",
      "why": "Since v = √(2gh), speed depends on the square root of height, not height directly",
      "solution": "To double the speed, you need to quadruple the height. Use the formula v = √(2gh) for accurate predictions."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting that mass cancels when calculating speed",
      "why": "Students expect heavier objects to fall faster because they have more PE, but PE and KE both depend on mass the same way",
      "solution": "In the equation mgh = ½mv², the mass m divides out: gh = ½v². Final speed v = √(2gh) is independent of mass."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Believing energy disappears",
      "why": "When friction slows an object, it seems like energy vanishes, but it's actually converted to heat",
      "solution": "Energy never disappears - it only transforms. Friction converts organized kinetic energy into disorganized thermal energy (heat)."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not recognizing potential energy as 'real' energy",
      "why": "PE seems abstract compared to obvious motion of KE, but PE is just as real and can do work",
      "solution": "Think of PE as 'stored' KE waiting to be released. A book on a shelf has energy that will be released if it falls."

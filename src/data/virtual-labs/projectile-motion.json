    "introduction": "Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. Examples include a thrown ball, a launched rocket, or water from a fountain.",

        "title": "Two-Dimensional Motion",
        "content": "Projectile motion is two-dimensional motion under constant acceleration (gravity). The motion can be broken down into two independent components:\n\n**Horizontal Motion (x-direction):**\n• Constant velocity (no acceleration)\n• No forces acting horizontally (ignoring air resistance)\n• Distance: x = v₀ × cos(θ) × t\n\n**Vertical Motion (y-direction):**\n• Constant downward acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²)\n• Initial upward velocity: v₀ × sin(θ)\n• Height: y = v₀ × sin(θ) × t - ½gt²\n\nThese two motions are completely independent of each other. The horizontal motion doesn't affect the vertical motion, and vice versa.",

        "title": "Parabolic Trajectory",
        "content": "The path of a projectile is always a parabola (assuming air resistance is negligible). This curved path results from:\n\n1. **Constant horizontal velocity** - moves forward at steady speed\n2. **Accelerated vertical motion** - speeds up downward due to gravity\n3. **Combination creates curve** - forward motion + downward acceleration = parabola\n\nThe parabola is symmetric: the time to reach maximum height equals the time to fall back down. The angle at landing equals the launch angle (on level ground).",

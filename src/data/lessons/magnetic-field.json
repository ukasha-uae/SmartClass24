    "electromagnets": "Electricity can be used to create magnets (electromagnets). When current flows through a coil of wire, it creates a magnetic field. The strength can be controlled by changing the current, and the magnet can be turned on and off.",
    "magneticDomains": "Materials like iron are made of tiny magnetic regions called domains. In unmagnetized iron, domains point in random directions. When magnetized, domains align, creating a net magnetic field.",
    "curieTmperature": "If a magnet is heated above its Curie temperature, the thermal energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains, causing the magnet to lose its magnetism.",

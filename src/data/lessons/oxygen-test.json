  "theory": {
    "introduction": "Oxygen (O₂) is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere. It is essential for respiration and combustion. The glowing splint test is a reliable qualitative test to identify the presence of oxygen gas.",
    "principle": "Oxygen supports combustion but is not itself flammable. When a glowing splint (wood with hot embers) is placed in concentrated oxygen, it provides enough oxygen molecules for rapid combustion, causing the splint to burst into flame.",
    "testReaction": {
      "positiveTest": "A glowing splint relights with a bright flame when placed in pure or concentrated oxygen",
      "negativeTest": "A glowing splint continues to glow briefly or goes out in air or gases without sufficient oxygen",
      "explanation": "The hot ember on the splint provides activation energy, and concentrated oxygen provides the reactant needed for rapid combustion of the wood"
    },
    "chemicalProcess": {
      "combustionReaction": "C (wood) + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy (heat and light)",
      "description": "The carbon in wood combines with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy in the form of heat and light",
      "energyRelease": "This is an exothermic reaction that releases energy, which we see as flames"

      "color": "Colorless",
      "odor": "Odorless",

    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Allow the splint to burn for 3-5 seconds to create a good ember",
      "note": "The wood should be burning well before proceeding"
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "instruction": "Blow out the flame, leaving the splint glowing (red ember visible)",
      "critical": "The splint must be glowing but NOT flaming for the test to work properly"
    },
    {
      "step": 7,
      "instruction": "Quickly insert the glowing splint into the test tube with oxygen",
      "timing": "Work quickly - the ember cools rapidly in air"
    },
    {
      "step": 8,
      "instruction": "Observe what happens and record your observations",
      "expected": "The splint should burst into flame with a bright glow"
    },
    {
      "step": 9,
      "instruction": "Prepare a new glowing splint (repeat steps 4-6)",
      "note": "Each test requires a fresh glowing splint"

      "observation": "The glowing splint immediately relights with a bright yellow-orange flame",
      "sound": "May hear a soft 'whoosh' as the splint ignites",
      "flame": "Bright, vigorous flame that burns the wood rapidly",
      "duration": "Flame continues until wood is consumed or oxygen is depleted",
      "conclusion": "POSITIVE test - confirms presence of oxygen gas"
    },
    "airTest": {
      "observation": "The glowing splint continues to glow for 1-2 seconds then goes out",
      "flame": "No flame appears - ember just fades away",
      "duration": "Ember visible for brief moment only",
      "explanation": "Air contains only 21% oxygen - insufficient concentration to relight splint",
      "conclusion": "NEGATIVE test - not enough oxygen to support rapid combustion"
    },
    "comparison": {
      "oxygenConcentration": "Pure O₂ vs 21% O₂ in air",
      "reactionSpeed": "Immediate flame vs slow extinguishing",
      "intensity": "Bright flame vs dim glow",
      "conclusion": "Oxygen concentration is key to the test's success"
    }
  },
  "analysis": {
    "whyItWorks": "The glowing splint has hot embers (around 600-700°C) but insufficient oxygen supply for sustained combustion. When placed in concentrated oxygen, the increased oxygen molecules collide more frequently with the hot wood particles, providing the oxygen needed for rapid combustion reaction.",
    "combustionTriangle": {
      "fuel": "Carbon and hydrogen in wood",
      "heat": "Hot ember provides activation energy (600-700°C)",
      "oxygen": "Pure O₂ provides abundant oxidizer",
      "result": "All three components combine to produce flame"
    },
    "molecularExplanation": "In pure oxygen, the concentration of O₂ molecules is approximately 5 times higher than in air. This dramatically increases the collision frequency between oxygen and hot wood particles, allowing rapid oxidation (burning) to occur.",
    "energyConsiderations": "The combustion of wood is exothermic, releasing approximately 15 MJ/kg. This energy sustains the flame once started. In air, the lower oxygen concentration cannot sustain this reaction rate."

  "theory": {
    "introduction": "Mixtures can be separated using different techniques based on the physical properties of their components. The choice of technique depends on whether the substances are solids or liquids, soluble or insoluble, and miscible or immiscible.",
    "types": {
      "filtration": {
        "principle": "Separates insoluble solid particles from liquid using a porous barrier (filter paper)",
        "mechanism": "Filter paper has tiny holes that allow liquid molecules to pass through but trap larger solid particles",
        "bestFor": "Insoluble solids mixed with liquids (e.g., sand in water, muddy water)",
        "terms": {
          "filtrate": "The liquid that passes through the filter",
          "residue": "The solid left behind on the filter paper"
        }
      },
      "evaporation": {
        "principle": "Separates dissolved solid from liquid by heating the solution until the liquid turns to vapor",
        "mechanism": "Heat provides energy for liquid molecules to overcome intermolecular forces and escape as gas. The dissolved solid cannot evaporate and remains as crystals",
        "bestFor": "Soluble solids dissolved in liquids (e.g., salt in water, sugar in tea)",
        "limitation": "Only useful when you want to recover the solid, not the liquid. The liquid is lost as vapor"
      },
      "decantation": {
        "principle": "Separates two immiscible liquids by carefully pouring off the top layer",
        "mechanism": "Based on density differences - less dense liquids float on top of denser liquids",
        "bestFor": "Immiscible liquids (e.g., oil and water, kerosene and water)",
        "note": "Can also be used for very dense solids that settle quickly at the bottom"
      }
    },
    "keyTerms": {
      "mixture": "Two or more substances physically combined, not chemically bonded",
      "solution": "A homogeneous mixture where one substance is dissolved in another",
      "soluble": "Able to dissolve in a particular solvent",
      "insoluble": "Cannot dissolve in a particular solvent",
      "miscible": "Liquids that can mix together (e.g., water and ethanol)",
      "immiscible": "Liquids that cannot mix together (e.g., oil and water)"

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Which separation technique is best for separating sand from water?",
      "options": [
        "Evaporation",
        "Filtration",
        "Decantation",
        "Distillation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Filtration is ideal for separating insoluble solids (sand) from liquids (water) because the filter paper traps solid particles while allowing liquid to pass through."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to water during evaporation of salt water?",
      "options": [
        "It remains in the dish",
        "It turns into vapor and escapes",
        "It mixes with salt",
        "It turns into ice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Heat provides energy for water molecules to overcome intermolecular forces and escape as water vapor (steam). The salt cannot evaporate and remains as solid crystals."

        "Sugar from tea"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Decantation is most effective for separating immiscible liquids like oil and water. Oil floats on top due to its lower density, allowing it to be poured off."

        "Solution",
        "Suspension"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The filtrate is the clear liquid that passes through the filter paper. The solid left behind on the filter is called the residue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does oil float on water during decantation?",
      "options": [
        "Oil is hot",
        "Oil is less dense than water",
        "Oil is magnetic",
        "Oil is acidic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Oil floats on water because it has a lower density (about 0.92 g/mL) compared to water (1.0 g/mL). Less dense substances float on top of denser substances."
    }
  ],
  "extendedLearning": {
    "advancedTechniques": "Other separation techniques include distillation (separates liquids with different boiling points), chromatography (separates colored compounds), centrifugation (uses spinning to separate by density), and magnetic separation (uses magnets for magnetic materials).",
    "industrialScale": "Industries use large-scale versions of these techniques. For example, oil refineries use distillation towers dozens of meters tall to separate crude oil into gasoline, diesel, and other products.",
    "combinedTechniques": "Complex mixtures often require multiple techniques. For example, separating a mixture of sand, salt, and water would require filtration (to remove sand) followed by evaporation (to obtain salt from the filtrate).",
    "naturalProcesses": "Nature uses separation techniques too! The water cycle involves evaporation and condensation. Kidneys filter blood. Plants filter water through their roots."

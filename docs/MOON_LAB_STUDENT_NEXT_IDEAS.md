# Moon Phases Lab – Next Ideas to Help Students

After the recent fixes (teacher speaks during auto-play, responsive start/stop, varied language), here are suggested next steps to support students.

## 1. **Check-for-understanding prompts**
- After every 2–3 phases during auto-play, the teacher asks a short question: e.g. *“Why do we see a Full Moon when the Moon is on the opposite side of Earth?”*
- Optional: multiple-choice or true/false in the panel; no grade, just “Check your answer” with brief feedback.
- Keeps attention and reinforces cause–effect (position → phase).

## 2. **“Why does it look like that?” on tap**
- When a student taps/clicks the Moon (or a phase label), show a one-sentence explanation of *why* that phase looks like that from Earth (e.g. angle to Sun, which half is lit).
- Reuses existing body selection; add a short “reason” string per phase so the teacher (or tooltip) can say it.

## 3. **Optional captions / readability**
- Toggle for on-screen captions of the teacher’s speech (for quiet environments, hearing differences, or language practice).
- Option to slow down TTS rate in settings so students can follow more easily.

## 4. **Recap at the end of the cycle**
- When auto-play completes one full lunar cycle, the teacher gives a 1–2 sentence recap: e.g. *“We’ve seen all eight phases. Remember: it’s the Moon’s position around Earth that changes what we see.”*
- Option to “Play again” or “Try the quiz” linking to existing content.

## 5. **Link to eclipses and tides**
- Short “Learn more” links or buttons: *“This same geometry causes eclipses”* and *“Spring vs neap tides”* that open the existing facts or a dedicated mini-section.
- Helps stronger students connect phases to eclipses and tides without overloading the main view.

**Priority suggestion:** Start with **(1) check-for-understanding** and **(2) “why does it look like that?”** on tap; they add the most learning value for minimal UI change.

**Quote from Wisdom Warehouse (UAE):**  
*"We searched for 2 years for a platform that could handle our custom branding and Middle East curriculum. Everything was either too Ghana-specific or too expensive."*

## Appendix: FAQs 🤔

**Q: What prevents competitors from copying your model?**  
A: Multi-tenant architecture is complex to build correctly. We have 6+ months head start, proven reliability (Wisdom Warehouse), and deep curriculum knowledge. Additionally, our Challenge Arena engagement model is unique IP.

**Q: How do you ensure content quality?**  
A: All questions reviewed by certified teachers, aligned with official syllabi, tested with 750+ students. Continuous feedback loop improves content.

**Q: What happens if a school cancels?**  
A: Churn mitigation: 30-day notice, data export, annual contracts (discount incentive), dedicated success managers.

**Q: Can you scale beyond Africa?**  
A: Yes! Our 3-layer architecture (Tenant → Curriculum → Localization) is explicitly designed for global scalability. Wisdom Warehouse (UAE) validates this with alternative-holistic curriculum for US expat students. V2 adds US Common Core, UK National, and IB. The platform is curriculum-agnostic - location doesn't dictate content. Next targets: Southeast Asia (IGCSE schools), Latin America (IB schools), North America (homeschool market).

**Q: What's your customer acquisition strategy?**  
A: Direct outreach to headmasters, EdTech conferences, Ministry partnerships, referral program (schools get commission), content marketing (SEO for "Ghana BECE prep", etc.).

**Q: How do you handle data privacy?**  
A: GDPR-compliant architecture, anonymized data by default, tenant data isolation (Firestore rules), regular security audits, parent consent for minors.

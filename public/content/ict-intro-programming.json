      "content": "Programming is the art and science of giving instructions to computers. Imagine you're explaining to a friend who has never been to Accra how to get from Circle to Osu. You'd give step-by-step directions: 'Walk to the main road, board a trotro heading to Osu, tell the mate to drop you at Oxford Street...' Programming is similar—you're giving computers detailed, logical instructions to accomplish tasks.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Programming is writing instructions in a special language computers understand\n- A program is like a recipe—a sequence of steps that must be followed in order\n- Computers are very literal—they do exactly what you tell them, nothing more, nothing less\n- Programming languages bridge the gap between human thinking and computer processing\n- Popular languages include Python (beginner-friendly), JavaScript (for websites), Java (for apps), Scratch (visual programming)\n- Every app on your phone, every website you visit, and every video game was created through programming\n\n**🎯 Think About It**: List 5 apps or programs you use daily (WhatsApp, TikTok, Calculator, etc.). What instructions do you think programmers gave computers to make these work?"

      "content": "Before you can write code, you need to think algorithmically. An algorithm is simply a step-by-step plan to solve a problem. You use algorithms every day without realizing it!\n\n**What is an Algorithm?**\n- 📋 **Definition**: A precise sequence of instructions that solves a specific problem\n- 🎯 **Must Have**: A clear start, definite steps, and an end\n- ✅ **Characteristics**: Finite (must end eventually), Definite (each step is clear), Effective (actually solves the problem)\n- 🍲 **Everyday Example**: Making waakye—boil rice and beans separately, add millet leaves, cook until done, serve with gari and shito\n- 📱 **Tech Example**: Sending a WhatsApp message—open app, select contact, type message, press send, wait for double tick\n- 🔄 **Can Include**: Sequences (one after another), Decisions (if this, then that), Repetition (do this many times)\n\n**✏️ Your Turn - Write an Algorithm**: Write step-by-step instructions for making a phone call. Start with 'Pick up phone' and end with 'End call'. Be very specific—remember, computers need exact instructions!\n\n**Example: Algorithm to Find the Largest of Three Numbers**\n1. START\n2. Get three numbers: A, B, and C\n3. Assume A is the largest\n4. IF B is greater than A, then B becomes the largest\n5. IF C is greater than the current largest, then C becomes the largest\n6. Display the largest number\n7. END\n\nNotice how we check each number systematically. This logical approach is the foundation of programming!"

It's especially helpful when explaining your ideas to others or debugging problems.\n\n**Flowchart Symbols:**\n- 🔵 **Oval/Terminal (⬭)**: Marks the START and END of your program\n- 📦 **Rectangle (▭)**: Represents a PROCESS or ACTION (e.g., 'Add 5 to total', 'Calculate average')\n- 💎 **Diamond (◇)**: Shows a DECISION point—always asks a Yes/No question (e.g., 'Is age > 18?')\n- 📥📤 **Parallelogram (▱)**: Indicates INPUT (getting data) or OUTPUT (showing results)\n- ➡️ **Arrows**: Show the flow direction—which step comes next\n- 📝 **Annotation (----)**: Add notes or comments to explain tricky parts\n\n**Flowchart Example: Checking if a Student Passed**\n```\nSTART (oval)\n  ↓\nINPUT: Get student's score (parallelogram)\n  ↓\nDECISION: Is score ≥ 50? (diamond)\n  ↓ Yes → OUTPUT: 'You Passed!' (parallelogram) → END\n  ↓ No → OUTPUT: 'You Failed' (parallelogram) → END\n```\n\n**🎨 Draw It Yourself**: Create a flowchart for withdrawing money from a mobile money account. Include: START, Enter PIN, Check if PIN is correct, Check if balance is sufficient, Dispense money or Show error, END"

      "content": "Think of variables as labeled boxes where you store information. Just like you might have a box labeled 'School Books' or 'Clothes', variables have names and hold specific types of data. The computer remembers what's in each box and can use it when needed.\n\n**Understanding Variables:**\n- 📦 **What is a Variable?**: A named storage location that holds a value that can change\n- 🏷️ **Variable Names**: Should be meaningful—use 'studentAge' not 'x', 'totalPrice' not 'tp'\n\n**Data Types:**\n- 🔢 **Integer**: Whole numbers (no decimals) → Examples: 18, -5, 1000, 0\n- 💯 **Float/Decimal**: Numbers with decimal points → Examples: 3.14, 98.6, -0.5, 2.0\n- 📝 **String**: Text or characters (always in quotes) → Examples: 'Kwame', 'Accra', 'GH¢50.00'\n- ✅❌ **Boolean**: Only two values—True or False → Examples: isPassed = True, hasInternet = False\n- 📊 **Why Data Types Matter**: Different types work differently—you can't add text to numbers!\n\n**Real-World Analogy**: Think of it like Mobile Money—Your account (variable name) stores your balance (value). The balance is a number (data type) that changes when you send or receive money.\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\n# Integer (whole number)\nstudentAge = 16\n\n# Float (decimal)\naverage_score = 78.5\n\n# String (text)\nstudentName = 'Ama Serwaa'\nschool = 'Ghana SHS'\n\n# Boolean (True/False)\nisPassed = True\nhasScholarship = False\n\n# Using variables\nprint('Name:', studentName)\nprint('Age:', studentAge)\nprint('Average:', average_score)\nprint('Passed?', isPassed)\n```\n\n**Variable Naming Rules:**\n- ✅ Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores\n- ✅ MUST start with a letter or underscore (not a number)\n- ✅ Case-sensitive: 'Name' and 'name' are different!\n- ❌ Cannot use spaces—use underscores instead: 'student_name' not 'student name'\n- ❌ Cannot use reserved words (like if, else, for, print)\n- 💡 Use camelCase (firstName) or snake_case (first_name)—be consistent!\n\n**🎯 Challenge**: Declare variables for a student record system: Student's name (string), Age (integer), Height in meters (float), Is SHS student? (boolean), Hometown (string)"

They make programs dynamic and intelligent instead of just following a straight line of instructions.\n\n**Three Types of Control Structures:**\n\n**1️⃣ Sequential Structure** - The simplest form: do step 1, then step 2, then step 3...\n\nExample: Making instant noodles\n1. Boil water\n2. Add noodles\n3. Wait 3 minutes\n4. Drain water\n5. Eat\n\n```python\nprint('Step 1')\nprint('Step 2')\nprint('Step 3')\n# Each line runs one after another\n```\n\n**2️⃣ Selection (If-Else)** - Make decisions based on conditions\n\nReal-world: Boarding a trotro\n```\nIF there's space:\n  Board the trotro\nELSE:\n  Wait for the next one\n```\n\nPython example:\n```python\nage = int(input('Enter your age: '))\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print('You can vote!')\n    print('Register now')\nelse:\n    print('You cannot vote yet')\n    years_left = 18 - age\n    print('Wait', years_left, 'more years')\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Condition must be True or False\n- If True: run the IF block\n- If False: run the ELSE block\n- You can have multiple conditions with ELIF (else-if)\n\n**3️⃣ Iteration (Loops)** - Repeat actions automatically\n\n**FOR Loop** - When you know HOW MANY times to repeat\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print('Ghana!')\n# Prints 'Ghana!' 5 times\n```\n\n**WHILE Loop** - Repeat UNTIL a condition becomes false\n```python\ncorrect_pin = '1234'\npin = ''\nwhile pin != correct_pin:\n    pin = input('Enter PIN: ')\n    if pin == correct_pin:\n        print('Access granted!')\n    else:\n        print('Wrong PIN, try again')\n```\n\n**Real-World Loop - Selling Waakye:**\n```\nWHILE there are customers in line:\n  - Take order\n  - Serve waakye\n  - Collect payment\n  - Move to next customer\n```\n\n**🎮 Fun Challenge - Guess the Number Game:**\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Computer picks random number 1-10\nsecret = random.randint(1, 10)\nattempts = 0\n\nprint('Guess my number (1-10)!')\n\nwhile True:\n    guess = int(input('Your guess: '))\n    attempts = attempts + 1\n    \n    if guess == secret:\n        print('🎉 Correct!

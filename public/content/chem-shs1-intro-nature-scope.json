  "introduction": "Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the study of matter—its composition, properties, and the changes it undergoes. It helps us understand how substances interact, react, and transform. When you cook rice, the raw grains absorb water and become soft. That change is a chemical process. When iron rusts, soap cleans your hands, or fruit gets ripe—chemistry is at work.",

          "gradingRubric": "4 marks for explaining its connection to at least two other major science fields with examples.",
          "modelAnswer": "Chemistry is called the central science because its principles are fundamental to understanding other scientific disciplines. It connects with **Biology** through biochemistry (the study of life processes), with **Physics** through physical chemistry (the study of energy and matter), and with **Geology** through geochemistry (the study of Earth's composition). For example, a biologist needs chemistry to understand digestion, and a physicist needs it to understand batteries."

Example: A lion hunting a zebra.\n\n- **Competition:** Organisms struggle for the same limited resources like food, water, or territory.\n\n- **Symbiosis:** A close, long-term interaction between two different species. This includes:\n  - **Mutualism:** Both species benefit (e.g., bees pollinating flowers).\n  - **Parasitism:** One benefits (parasite) and the other is harmed (host) (e.g., a tick on a dog).\n  - **Commensalism:** One benefits, and the other is unaffected (e.g., a bird nesting in a tree)."
